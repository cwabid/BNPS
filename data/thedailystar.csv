‘Stand by us’,"Family members of those martyred during the July-August mass uprising have accused the interim government of neglecting their plight and failing to deliver justice. At a press conference held in front of Jatiya Press Club yesterday, they alleged that the government has made no significant progress in arresting or prosecuting those responsible for the killings, nor has it officially recognised the martyrs. Many families are living in dire conditions, they claimed, as no steps have been taken to rehabilitate them. The families announced they would begin a sit-in and hunger strike on February 4 if their demands are not met by tomorrow. At least 20 relatives of the martyrs, including mothers, fathers, siblings, spouses, and children, spoke at the event titled ""Ensuring Immediate Arrest and Trial of All Perpetrators, and Securing the Just Demands of the Martyrs' Families."" Bithi Akter, widow of Hafizur Rahman, who was shot in Agargaon on August 5 and died on August 16, said, ""If you cannot fulfil our demands, then kill us too. We have no reason to live anymore."" ""My child asks for food and clothes, but I cannot provide. My landlord doesn't excuse the rent for a single month. If the government refuses our demands, then kill us, kill our children too -- we'll all become martyrs, and no one will remain to protest on the streets,"" she said. Reema Akter, whose husband Mohammad Sohag was killed in Bangshal, said, ""Why is the government ignoring us? Why do we have to beg for what is rightfully ours? We cannot bear this anymore. Please stand by us."" Rabiul Awal, whose brother Imam Hasan (Taim) was killed in police firing in Jatrabari, said he has been seeking justice for six months without any progress. ""For months, I've run from one government office to another, but none of the perpetrators have been arrested or put on trial,"" he said. Shahina Begum, mother of Sajjad Hossain, who was killed in Ashulia on August 5 and had his body burned after his death, broke down in tears. ""They killed my son like an animal and then burned his body. Yet no one has been arrested. If the criminals are not caught, how will justice be served?"" Many families also spoke of their struggles after losing their primary earning members. Saidur Rahman Khan, grandfather of Shahriar Khan Anas, who was shot dead in Chankharpul, said, ""This government was formed based on the martyrs' sacrifices. But now it has abandoned us. Its first responsibility should have been to support the martyrs' families, yet we are being forced to protest for our rights."" Mosharraf Hossain, father of journalist Mehedi Hasan, who was killed in Jatrabari, asked, ""What was his crime? Was reporting the truth a crime? The fascist regime murdered my son for delivering news. The interim government made many promises, but nothing has been done for us."" Abul Hasan, father of Shahriar Hasan Alvi, who was shot dead in Mirpur, moderated the event. ""The government hasn't inquired about any of the martyr families. Many of us are living in inhumane conditions. Some families can't even afford milk for their children,"" he said."
"1,800 people get free health check-ups","A daylong free health check-up camp for underprivileged people was organised in Narail Sadar upazila on Friday. Faraaz Hossain Foundation in collaboration with Sharif Atiar Rahman Smriti Parishad organised the camp at RBFM Bhabanipur Secondary School ground. Since morning till evening, there were long queues of people at the camp where a team of 21 specialised doctors provided service to around 1,800 people from surrounding villages. The services include blood pressure and diabetes check-ups. They were also given medicines free of charge. The camp was held commemorating Faraaz Ayaaz Hossain. Faraaz has become an epitome of supreme sacrifice for the cause of humanity. His refusal to leave his friends during the militant attack at Gulshan's Holey Artisan Bakery on July 1, 2016 was not only an act of bravery that the world saluted but also set the burning example of what a pristine youthful mind can do when it comes to choosing the right path at the expense of mere mortality.A discussion was also held as part of the event. Among others, Narail Deputy Commissioner Sharmin Akter Jahan, Bangladesh Southern University VC Sharif Ashrafuzzaman and former Narail Sadar upazila chairman Sharif Humayun Kabir were present."
Arakan Army releases cargo vessel after 16 days,"A cargo vessel carrying 1,600 sacks of dried fish reached Teknaf Land Port yesterday after it was released by Arakan Army. The Myanmar-based rebel group had seized the vessel 16 days back on its way to Teknaf from Yangon. The vessel arrived at the Teknaf Land Port jetty at 12:45pm yesterday, said port officials. Syed Mohammad Anwar Hossain, manager of United Land Port in Teknaf, said, ""The boat is now anchored at the jetty. Once the procedures are completed, the goods will be unloaded."" The Arakan Army had seized three boats on January 16 at the Naf river estuary while those were en route to Teknaf carrying 50,000 sacks of dried fish, betel nuts, coffee, and other goods. Later, on January 20, the Arakan Army released two of the cargo boats carrying 27,722 sacks of goods. ""The two other boats, which earlier reached Teknaf after being released from Arakan Army's custody, were unloaded and sent back to Yangon,"" Anwar Hossain added."
Only wealthy have access to politics,"Elections in Bangladesh are an expensive affair, with candidates spending between Tk 5-10 crore to secure nominations and for their campaigns, according to a report by the Westminster Foundation for Democracy. The situation has worsened in recent years -- particularly during the past four Awami League-led governments from 2009 to 2024 -- where the influence of financial resources in politics has increased dramatically, it said. The rising costs of electioneering have created barriers for many aspiring politicians, particularly those from, less affluent backgrounds and marginalised communities, including women and youth, said the report titled ""The cost of politics in Bangladesh"". The report was prepared by the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, the UK public body dedicated to strengthening democracy and open societies around the world. The research for the report was done between July and December last year. As many as 25 in-depth key informant interviews were taken with former members of parliament, election officials and other stakeholders. Two focused group discussions were held. Researchers also gathered data from secondary sources from government publications, prominent international organisations and academic literature that delves into the political economy of Bangladesh. To put themselves in contention for nomination, candidates often spend money on community events, make donations to local institutions and work to build public support through informal patron-client networks, the report said. ""A common perception in Bangladesh is that those unable to spend money cannot be credible candidates for MP."" Many politicians interviewed for the report indicated that candidates often spend between Tk 2 to 5 crore to gain the favour of influential party leaders, particularly within the AL and Jatiya Party. ""In some cases, additional payments were allegedly made directly to members of the prime minister's family to secure nominations,"" it said. Jatiya Party Secretary General Mujibul Haque denied the allegations brought on by the report. ""This allegation is an absurd one. None have to pay for getting party nomination,"" he told The Daily Star. During the campaign phase, candidates need to spend Tk 3-5 crore or even more depending on the constituency and level of competition. Candidates have to spend money on the day of the polls to secure votes on top of their electioneering costs: a minimum of Tk 50 lakh was spent on average per candidate on the election day. Vote buying was a feature of all election contests in 2024, with payments per vote being Tk 1,000 to Tk 5,000. Candidates in Bangladesh's elections typically rely on formal and informal funding sources. The formal sources include contributions from political parties and personal savings. Informal sources include donations from businesses, vested interest groups and sometimes illicit contributions from foreign actors and criminal syndicates. This illegal funding typically originates from tax evasion, extortion and organised crime syndicates, which provide financial backing to candidates in exchange for political influence once elected, the report said. Even after winning the election, some candidates need to spend another Tk 4 to 5 lakh to expedite administrative processes such as the official publication of election results or necessary documentation. ""Because of the highly expensive election process, only people who have wealth are getting the chance to enter into politics,"" said Shahab Enam Khan, one of the researchers for the report and a professor of international relations at Jahangirnagar University. As much as 85 percent of the MPs possess movable or liquid assets worth Tk 1 crore each or more in 2024, according to Transparency International Bangladesh. Nearly 82 percent of the lawmakers possessed assets worth more than Tk 1 crore in the 2018 parliament, according to Shushashoner Jonno Nagorik. Some of the interviewees even said that the election expenditure might be about Tk 100 crore in some constituencies, said Nurul Huda Sakib, another researcher for the report. ""High election expenditure has become a normal matter. We reported the average figure of election expense, the figure might be much more than that."" The high cost of elections is leading to an increasing number of businessmen entering politics, he said. ""This trend is also contributing to the growth of crony capitalism and kleptocracy,"" said Sakib, a professor at Jahangirnagar University's department of government and politics. As much as 66 percent of the elected MPs were businessmen in the 2024 parliament.  In the 1991 parliament, 38 percent of the MPs were businessmen. In the 1973 parliament, only 18 percent of the MPs were businessmen. ""The use of money and muscle have increased businessmen in politics and as a whole criminalised politics,"" said Ruhin Hossain Prince, general secretary of Ruhin Hossain Prince. To strengthen legal frameworks and promote a coordinated approach in deterring financial misconduct, kleptocracy and the illicit use of wealth in electoral processes, fostering collaboration among key institutions is essential, the report said. It proposed a task force composed of the Anti-Corruption Commission, the Information Commission of Bangladesh, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Election Commission to oversee the political parties' candidate selection processes and campaigns. The report also suggested facilitating party nomination based on merit rather than privilege."
BNP drafts July uprising declaration,"The BNP has finalised its draft declaration of the July uprising. It is currently discussing the draft with allies and like-minded parties for their feedback to ensure broader acceptance. The party would interact with the advisers of the concerned ministries later and the declaration would take a final shape after reaching a greater consensus, BNP standing committee member Salahuddin Ahmed told The Daily Star. The draft was made as per the discussion in a meeting held with Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus and other political parties on January 16, he said. ""I believe the declaration should bear signatures of all parties concerned, as it carries political and historical significance. The process is ongoing, and we, all stakeholders, need to have patience,"" he added. For input from other anti-fascist political parties to refine the document and discuss its upcoming programmes, the BNP held meetings with the 12-party alliance, Jamiat Ulama-e-Islam Bangladesh, and Jatiyatabadi Samamona Jote in the last two days. It plans further discussions with its partners and those who boycotted the last parliamentary election in January 2024. The draft declaration traces its roots from the 1971 Liberation War to the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government following the July-August mass uprising led by students last year, according to party sources. They say the declaration underscores a firm commitment to preventing the resurgence of fascism and ensuring justice for crimes against humanity, including enforced disappearances and killings during Hasina's rule. It also stresses the urgency of holding free and fair polls and completing constitutional reforms through an elected parliament. Leaders of the Students Against Discrimination, which spearheaded the uprising, and its citizen platform the Jatiya Nagorik Committee attempted to make a July uprising proclamation in late December last year. However, the government said it would make the proclamation itself after consensus among all the parties. After the uprising leaders submitted their draft to political parties, an all-party meeting was convened on January 16. The BNP decided to support the students' initiative with necessary revisions. According to party sources, the party has carefully chosen the term ""declaration"" rather than ""proclamation"" for the document. They said the BNP decided to draft the declaration after discussing the matter within its policymaking forum. A standing committee member, who was involved in drafting the declaration, said that BNP adopted aspects of the students' proclamation that align with the party's ideology. ""We have modified and reformulated the unreasonable aspects of the students' manifesto,"" the leader added, speaking to this newspaper on condition of anonymity. According to sources, the party believes the declaration remains relevant despite the time elapsed since the uprising and the formation of the interim government. The core elements of the draft would remain intact, with possible minor adjustments based on the feedback from allies, according to the party sources. Meanwhile, a comparison between the student-led draft and BNP's version reveals key differences. The students refer to the 1971 war as a ""People's War"" while the BNP calls it the ""Liberation War"", explicitly mentioning the March 26, 1971, independence declaration, which is absent in the students' draft. On constitutional reforms, the students criticise the 1972 constitution for failing to reflect the aspirations of Liberation War participants, advocating for its amendment or abolition. The BNP, however, proposes systematic reforms through an elected parliament. Its draft also highlights the formation of the interim government on August 8, 2024, led by Prof Muhammad Yunus, based on the Supreme Court's opinion under article 106 of the constitution. In contrast, the students' draft demands immediate structural reforms before the next election. It credits the Students Against Discrimination for leading the July uprising, while the BNP's version attributes the mass movement to people from all sectors of society. The BNP's draft includes detailed casualty figures, citing over 2,000 deaths, including of women and children, and thousands left with life-altering injuries like the loss of a limb or eyesight. The details are absent in the students' draft. While the students focus on the persecution of students and youths under Awami League rule, the BNP's draft broadens the scope to include opposition leaders, activists, and others. Both drafts demand justice for crimes committed during the uprising, while the BNP also wants justice for the crimes during the 16 years of fascist rule, including enforced disappearances and human rights violations. The students' draft calls for a ""New Republic"" to address systemic oppression and inequality, urging official recognition of their declaration effective from August 5, 2024. On the other hand, the BNP's draft focuses on constitutional reforms through an elected parliament, avoiding the term ""New Republic"". The BNP focuses more on the political struggle against the Awami League, describing the uprising as a continuation of the struggle, and emphasising the role of political parties and other organisations in leading the movement. The students' draft focuses on the broader societal impact of discrimination, corruption, and environmental degradation, emphasising the role of students and common people in the movement."
"Interview /  ‘No room for politics under AL name, ideology’","As the interim government is going to complete its six months in office, calls for the national election are growing louder. Several reform commissions have already submitted their reports, and the government may soon engage with political parties. Nahid Islam, a July uprising leader, who is now serving as an adviser to the interim government, lately spoke with The Daily Star's Wasim Bin Habib and Baharam Khan on a range of pressing issues. TDS:How would you evaluate the six months since the interim government took office? Nahid: We assumed responsibilities in an extraordinary situation and have been navigating a kind of revolutionary phase. It was an unprecedented situation for Bangladesh. Naturally, there was tension and uncertainty. However, over the past six months, the situation has become more stable. Although progress is slow, things are improving. People may have expected faster actions, but various constraints posed limitations. Despite these, the government is doing its best. TDS:What were the main challenges during this time? Nahid: The biggest challenges were maintaining law and order and stabilising the prices of essentials. Ensuring national unity while meeting people's expectations has always been a challenge. As everyone can see, the government's structure is small, but it's work scope is quite extensive. We've to move forwards by maintaining a balance among political parties while keeping national unity intact. Meanwhile, the reform commissions are submitting their reports. begun, with arrests already underway. So, I believe we're making progress. If the political parties show more goodwill, we can advance at a faster pace. TDS: What were the things you wanted to achieve during this period but couldn't? Nahid: There are some regrets. If we could take some stricter measures from the very beginning, changes could have come sooner. Over these six months, we haven't been able to improve the administrative and law and order situations to the desired level. That said, our biggest achievement has been the transition from uncertainty to stability. In the early days, there were speculations about whether the government would remain in power, or there would be a counter-revolution. There were conspiracies within the country, along with geopolitical pressures. There was an international campaign against us, and tensions surrounding minority communities in the country were deliberately flared. Now, those tensions have largely subsided. I believe this is significant progress. TDS: As for the law-and-order situation, incidents like muggings are occurring daily, even in broad daylight, which is concerning. Nahid: Yes, that's true -- some challenges still exist. Incidents of mugging and criminal activities are occurring in some areas. We're trying to restore the police's morale to its previous state. The police force is currently undergoing a transformation including new training and restructuring. However, such comprehensive changes take time. For example, many members of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police have been transferred outside Dhaka, and new officers have been brought to the capital. This transition period has created temporary challenges, as officers need time to adjust to their new environments. Initially, there was criticism when the police were perceived as inactive (following the fall of the AL government). Then when they took decisive actions, there was criticism again. Such contradictions make it difficult for them to stabilise. That said, we are committed to ensuring that the police regain full operational capacity. TDS: Why was the police uniform changed? Do you think it'll lead to any qualitative improvement in the force? Nahid: We don't expect a change in the uniform will solve everything, but it carries symbolic and psychological significance. A few days ago, I visited the graves of some martyrs. Relatives of one of the martyrs were infuriated upon seeing uniformed police officers who were accompanying me, even though they had no involvement in the deaths. The reactions might have been different if the officers were in plainclothes, as the primary identity of a force is represented through its uniform. This aspect is being taken into consideration. On one hand, we expect police to protect human rights, while on the other, they're responsible for controlling riots. The government is working to improve police effectiveness through advanced training. TDS: Various shrines have been attacked, while a girls' football match was disrupted. What're the reasons? Nahid: These incidents are deeply concerning and unacceptable, and may have occurred due to gaps in law-and-order situation. We acknowledge that such events are embarrassing for the government. We're taking these incidents seriously and trying to take appropriate action, while also considering compensation to the affected shrines. TDS: The students and youth say the election should be held after reforms. On the other hand, the chief adviser has announced an election timeline. Is there a conflicting position between these two issues? Nahid: From the beginning, we've maintained that elections and reforms are not contradictory. In fact, while elections are crucial for democracy, but reforms are equally necessary to ensure fair polls. Over the past 15 years, elections haven't been conducted properly. The people have lost much of their faith in the electoral institutions. During the (July-August) movement, we said we wanted to create a new arrangement to prevent the return of fascism. We want to ensure that no future government can manipulate the electoral system for party or personal gains. This is a long-term process, but we want to lay the foundation now. We want to take political (parties') commitment so that whoever comes to power will continue the reforms. TDS: Do you think the reforms can be completed within the timeframe set by the chief adviser? Nahid: If you notice, the first six reform commissions we formed are related to state structure and electoral reforms. Some of the commissions have already submitted their reports. We plan to discuss these issues with political parties this month. The parties were eager to know a specific timeframe. From that perspective, we believe the timeframe given by the chief adviser is consistent with the reform initiatives. TDS: BNP previously suggested that the election could be held on August 5, terming it a historic date. What is your response to this? Nahid: August 5 will also be a historic date in 2026. If this date is chosen as a milestone for the democratic journey, I don't see an issue. TDS: There are discussions regarding a political party by the students and youth, and the resignation of two advisers including yourself. Will you really be resigning? Nahid: As advisers, we're still focused on the government responsibilities. No decision has yet been made regarding our resignations. TDS: Since you were a key figure in the July uprising, many expect you to join a party. What's your personal view on this? Nahid: I haven't decided yet. My focus remains on where I can contribute most effectively. I need to carefully assess whether I can make a greater impact within the government or by working on the ground. When the time comes, I will make that decision based on what best serves the country. TDS: BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul has raised questions about the government's neutrality. Do you think this is related to the formation of the students' party? Nahid: The students didn't form a party immediately after the uprising in order to gain the trust of the political parties. If they had, many other would have shown interest in being involved and they still might. So, you can understand the perspective of the youth. The government prioritising the advice of political parties in making key decisions. When the issue of removing the president arose, we did the same. Therefore, BNP's allegations of bias aren't justified. I don't know if they're considering any alternative plan or other options by removing Dr Yunus. If they are, I don't believe it will serve them or the country well. TDS: Is there any crack developing in national unity? Nahid:The uprising brought together people from different political and ideological backgrounds. Naturally, there were differences, but that doesn't mean there is a lack of unity. During the movement, we took a united stance. So, differences will exist, but this does not mean it's a weakness. We don't expect everyone to have the same stance over every issue. However, the key question is how united we can remain on major national challenges. I believe that national unity is still intact. If it weren't and political parties didn't cooperate, it would've been more difficult to run the government. I hope this cooperation will continue in the future. Through our collective efforts, if we can maintain a consistent path towards reforms and ensure a responsible democratic transition, it'll be an achievement for all, especially those in the upcoming government. Their task will be easier. TDS: How much reform can realistically be accomplished? There isn't much time. Nahid: That's precisely why we weren't eager to announce an election timeline in haste. If even the minimal expectations of the people, shaped by the mass uprising and consequent bloodshed, are not met, they will lose faith in us and take to the streets. Sheikh Hasina's government was also an ""elected government"" in 2008, but it committed misdeeds. This suggests that an elected government doesn't necessarily guarantee the country's safety. We're aware of the recommendations made by ""Teen Joter Ruprekha (roughly translated to 'tri-alliance outline')"" in 1990, but those plans weren't implemented. This time, we aim to create a roadmap for the public through reforms in the state structure, which can continue no matter who comes to power next. TDS: Several journalists have been arrested and are in jail. Many were charged with murder, and some were laid off. Can these not be seen as a threat to freedom of press? Nahid: No one has been arrested for criticising the interim government. However, some individuals in the media are facing legal proceedings due to allegations of criminal activity that extend beyond journalism. Many of those who were closely involved with the previous regime and failed to uphold journalistic ethics, who were complicit with fascism, are accused of being involved in (the July) killings. However, I believe the role of journalists and the media over the past 15 years needs deeper discussion. It isn't possible to address these through the legal framework. There must also be some form of accountability for those who committed moral or social wrongs as collaborators of fascism.If the government takes such measures, it may be questioned. I think the initiative should come from within the media itself through independent reviews and professional standards bodies. TDS: While there may be allegations of financial wrongdoings against some journalists, but many are charged with murder. Isn't this putting pressure on other journalists? Nahid: We've ensured a process for review if any case isn't filed properly. We've also communicated with the law ministry regarding the accused in cases who have applied for a review. Some journalists are also facing corruption allegations, which are being investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission and other relevant government agencies. The government isn't pressuring the media, but there is undeniable public frustration. However, certain groups have portrayed this internationally as a crackdown on press freedom, which does not reflect the full picture. In the past, media outlets were forcibly shut down following changes in government. That hasn't happened since this government was formed, though there's resentment among the people over the role of some media outlets. I won't take names, but certain media outlets directly supported the fascist government during the July uprising. Was that ethical? To this day, they haven't acknowledged their role, nor have they explained their actions.They didn't say they wouldn't repeat such practices in the future. If the journalists who compromised ethical standards in the past takeresponsibility, acknowledge their misdeeds, and commit to not doing so in the future, this pressure perhaps will also lessen. TDS: The recently approved draft of the Cyber Protection Ordinance-2024 contains several repressive provisions, as highlighted by civil society groups such as Transparency International Bangladesh. What are your thoughts? Nahid: The law is being revised to ensure journalists and all sectors of society have freedom of speech and expression. I admit our government rushed the drafting process. The intention was to pass it quickly so that the victims of false cases filed under the Cyber Security Act could get some relief. Now, we've decided to cancel cases related to speech and writing offenses. TDS: Will the government take into account the concerns raised by stakeholders? Nahid: Absolutely. Further discussions will take place. We aim to create the best possible law with input from all stakeholders. I believe we can do that if stakeholder meetings are held properly. TDS: In your opinion, what will be the future of Awami League politics? Will it be able to participate in the next polls? Will it be banned? Nahid: It can't be definitively said at this moment. Whether Awami League should be banned or allowed to contest polle is something that requires national consensus. It'll also depend on the decisions from the courts and the Election Commission. However, as those who led the uprising, we believe Awami League has lost its moral and legal legitimacy to continue politics. TDS: But you have mentioned reconciliation… Nahid: Yes, but not under Awami League's banner. Those from the Sheikh family or individuals identified as corrupt or involved in mass killings have no right to continue politics. TDS: What about Awami League members who were not involved in corruption or violence? Nahid: There is no room for politics under the name or ideology of Awami League. Their ideology is fascist, which led to 15 years of oppression and mass killings. Those who realise their mistakes must abandon that ideology. Their political and civil rights remain intact -- they can join other parties or form a new one. TDS: If someone from the Awami League, who wants a clean image, wants to join the Anti-discrimination Students' Movement – would you accept them? Nahid: I am not currently involved with the platform, so I don't want to comment. TDS: You don't want Awami League to continue politics, but there's no provision for prosecuting a party in the amended ICT Act… Nahid: At that time, the decision was made based on consultations with national and international stakeholders. Legal experts and learned advisers of the advisory council gave their input. Our main focus is to ensure that the judicial process is not questioned. However, there're other ways to ban a party outside courts as well. TDS: Is such an initiative being taken? Nahid: For now, we're focusing on the judicial process. Once progress is made in that regard, decisions on related matters will become easier. TDS: Critics say if the prosecution of a party was included in the law, Jamaat-e-Islami would have to be prosecuted for its 1971 crimes as well… Nahid: That's not the case at all. After discussing with experts, all necessary actions to maintain international standards have been taken. TDS: Could you share something about the progress of the judicial process in ICT? Nahid: We hope that the judicial proceedings of the important cases will begin before August. TDS: Will the election be held after that? Nahid: It'll depend on the judicial timeline. However, our aim is for the public to see justice being served, and then move forward with a fair and credible election. TDS: If everything goes well, we'll be heading toward an election atmosphere in six months. What do you plan to do during this time? Nahid: Law and order, along with the economic condition, need further improvement. If the police aren't properly operational, holding an election will be difficult. Many people might've thought that an election will fix everything, but that's not the case. A good election requires a conducive atmosphere. We want to organise the most transparent and credible election in the country's history. The 1991 election is often considered the country's fairest election, but we aim to set an even higher standard. TDS: What challenges do you foresee? Nahid: Many Awami League goons are conspiring to destabilise the government. They're attempting various forms of sabotage with the support of foreign powers. Leaders and activists of different political parties in the country are getting involved in extortion and other criminal activities. We need to tackle these while moving towards the election. This isn't just for polls; it's essential for foreign investment and internal business environment. TDS: What does the interim government want to achieve within its first year? Nahid: The most significant one could be visible progress in the trial of the July massacre. People across the country are eagerly waiting for this. We want to ensure that martyr families and the injured are adequately compensated and rehabilitated. Law and order should reach a satisfactory level. Reform initiatives should lead to a political consensus so that we can present a framework for unity to the nation and ensure that future governments will continue the rest of the work."
Vandalism at Venue: Girls’ football match to be rescheduled soon,"The Joypurhat district administration has announced to reschedule a women's football match, which was previously cancelled after being disrupted following vandalism of the tin fence surrounding the playing field. The decision was conveyed on Friday after a meeting between an investigation committee, the organisers, and local religious leaders, said Anisur Rahman, officer-in-charge of Akkelpur Police Station. Members of the investigation committee, accompanied by an army team, visited the playing field and spoke with local residents. Law and order in the area remained stable, he added. Akkelpur upazila nirbahi officer Manzurul Alam, a member of the probe body, said that the incident resulted from a ""misunderstanding"", as acknowledged by local religious leaders. He assured that there were no longer any obstacles to women's football being played on the field, adding that arrangements for the match would be made soon. Some individuals involved in the vandalism were also present and attributed the incident to ""miscommunication"". Mostakim Hossain, a teacher of the local Bacha Haji Madrasa, expressed regret over the incident and apologised for the disruption of the women's football match in Tilakpur on Tuesday. ""A misunderstanding among locals led to this unfortunate event, and we feel ashamed before the nation and the world. We assure that such an incident will not happen again in Joypurhat,"" he said. Nazrul Islam, president of Tilakpur union unit of Jamaat-e-Islami, said, ""We support sports being conducted in accordance with government regulations. The incident was caused by a misunderstanding among local Muslims, and we do not want such occurrences in the future."" Abdus Samad, khatib of Tilakpur Purono Bazar Jam-e Mosque, clarified that there had neither been any opposition to the match itself nor were any objection to the game taking place openly. Samiul Hasan, president of the organising club T-Star and also organisational secretary of the upazila unit BNP, described the incident as a ""misunderstanding"" and assured that the issue would be resolved promptly."
Amar Ekushey-2 / Language Movement in Faridpur,"This year marks the 73rd anniversary of the 1952 Language Movement. Drawing on research based on various published books, this 21-part series tells the story of the historic struggle for our mother tongue. Like other parts of the country, the demand for Bangla as a state language was made also in Faridpur, where the Language Movement began in 1948. In February of that year, Muslim League leaders and many other members of the Pakistan Constituent Assembly opposed a proposal to use Bangla in state affairs. Immediately afterwards, like their peers in Dhaka, the students of Faridpur also erupted in protests centring Rajendra College and the schools. According to Ahmed Rafiq's book Bhasha Andolan: Teknaf Theke Tetulia, the protesters in Faridpur decided to successfully enforce a strike announced centrally from Dhaka for March 11, 1948 by the Rashtrabhasha Sangram Parishad. Rajendra College students, led by Syed Mahbub Ali, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Abdul Matin and others, started campaigning for the strike in the last week of February through processions and street rallies. A spontaneous strike was observed in Faridpur, Dr Abu Muhammad Delwar Hossain wrote in his book Bhasha Andolaner Ancholik Itihas. Police baton-charged the protesters, injuring Mahbub Ali, Mohiuddin Ahmed and several others when the demonstrators brought out a procession from Rajendra College and started marching around the city. The police detained 11 student leaders, but released them later due to the sympathetic role of Faridpur district's administrator Abdul Halim Chowdhury. After the government declared Urdu as the sole state language of Pakistan on January 27, 1952, a Rashtrabhasha Sangram Committee was formed in Faridpur in early February, with Imamuddin Ahmed as the president and Monowar Hossain as the general secretary. With the support of leftist leaders and activists, the movement spread all over Greater Faridpur. A Flag Day was observed in Faridpur on February 4. And it was decided that a strike would be enforced on February 21. According to the book Bhasha Andolone Faridpur by Rezaul Karim, the agitated students took to the streets when the news of killings of students in police firing in Dhaka on February 21 reached Faridpur that afternoon through telegram. Several student protesters in Faridpur were injured when the police clubbed them outside Kotwali Police Station. A full-day strike was observed in Faridpur on February 22. On that day, the students marched from Rajendra College to Chawkbazar Mosque in violation of section 144 of the CrPC, which restricts gatherings. The police attacked the procession and arrested several demonstrators. In protest, the students staged a sit-in outside Kotwali Police Station until the police released the arrested students at midnight. From February 23, Faridpur practically became a city of processions. All administrative activities came to a standstill as the movement spread to the rural areas. In protest against the killings in Dhaka, school students also joined the processions in Faridpur. The Daily Azad newspaper on February 27 reported that the students of Char Atra Azizia Junior High Madrasa in Faridpur enforced a full-scale general strike against the killings in Dhaka. They also flew the national flag at half-mast, brought out a procession and held a rally. [Translated and edited by Osham-ul-Sufian Talukder]"
Dhaka-Rangpur highway: 25 hurt as six vehicles crash amid dense fog,"At least 25 people were injured in a road accident involving six vehicles on Dhaka-Rangpur highway amid dense fog yesterday morning. The vehicles, including two passenger buses, a truck, a pick-up, and a covered van, collided at Garer Matha Mor (intersection) in Mithapukur area around 7:30am. According to highway police and local sources, the vehicles, travelling from Dhaka, lost control due to poor visibility and crashed into each other at the intersection. On information, officials from Barodorga Highway Police Outpost reached the spot, rescued the injured, and arranged for their treatment. They also initiated the process of clearing the damaged vehicles from the highway. Those with serious injuries were rushed to nearby hospitals. Md Moniruzzaman, in-charge of the highway police outpost, confirmed the incident and said the situation returned to normalcy by afternoon. He further explained that heavy sand and soil-laden trucks had left the road slippery, which, alongside poor visibility amid fog, caused the drivers to lose control over steering, causing collision. ""In many areas, visibility has significantly decreased. Drivers and passengers are advised to use headlights and drive cautiously,"" Moniruzzaman added."
Demo at titumir college: People suffer as students keep blocking road,"Private firm employee Mohammad Ekram Hossain visited Chandrima Udyan with his wife and daughter to enjoy the weekend. As evening approached, he hired an autorickshaw to head home to Madhya Badda. However, the journey came to an abrupt halt at Amtoli in Mohakhali around 6:00pm as students of Government Titumir College blocked the road for the third consecutive day on Saturday to press for the demand that the college be turned into a university. For the next 50 minutes, Ekram and his family waited inside the autorickshaw, hoping for a way to continue their journey. When the students announced an hour-long blockade at Gulshan-1 intersection, Ekram chose to walk home. ""Road blockades occur at any time. There is no security on the road. We do not know when the road will be cleared. No one knows anything, and there was no police,"" a frustrated Ekram told The Daily Star. Contacted, Al Amin Hossain, additional deputy commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (Gulshan Zone), said police were on alert. ""We have remained near the gathering to monitor the situation and maintain law and order. We will take action if any untoward incidents occur."" As the students' ultimatum to meet their demand remained unfulfilled, they blocked the road outside the college after 4:00pm. As a result, traffic on both sides of Bir Uttam AK Khandaker Road, from Mohakhali to Gulshan-1, came to a standstill. After 6:15pm, the protesters marched towards Gulshan-1 and blocked the intersection around 6:40pm, which caused a traffic jam that lasted until 7:50pm. The students then announced the withdrawal of the blockade from the intersection, considering public suffering. However, they soon marched back to the college gate and resumed blocking the road at Mohakhali. The students ended their demonstration for the day around 8:10pm, vowing to resume the protests and continue until their demands are met. Mahmudul Hasan Muktar, a political science student and spokesperson for the protesters, said, ""We will engage in talks only if someone comes forward with a proposal on a full-fledged university."" He added they would strongly resist any attempts to politicise their demand. On Friday, the protesters issued an ultimatum, demanding that Titumir College be declared a university by 4:00pm the next day, or they would block roads or railways in north Dhaka under the programme ""Barasat Barricade to North City"". Some students had been on a hunger strike in front of the college's main gate since Thursday. As of yesterday, 12 students were on hunger strike. Six of them were hospitalised after falling ill. Meanwhile, the education ministry urged the protesters to have patience, saying that the issue was under consideration. It said in a statement that a committee, led by the University Grants Commission chairman, is working on plans to establish a separate university for the seven colleges affiliated with Dhaka University, including Titumir College. The ministry said the concerns of the students were being addressed with empathy, and the committee already held discussions with student representatives from Titumir College and the other six colleges. The statement said the government was committed to enhancing educational opportunities and improving the quality of these institutions. It added that all possible solutions are being explored. The ministry also advised the protesters to refrain from setting deadlines and actions that could disrupt public life or interfere with regular academic activities at the college."
Death in custody: Army camp commander withdrawn,"The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) has announced the formation of a high-level investigation committee to determine the cause ofdeath of Jubo Dal leader Touhidul Islamin Cumilla. The armed forces' press wing also said that legal action would be taken against those found guilty as per military law. ""Appropriate steps have been taken to investigate this unexpected and regrettable incident. In the meantime, the commander of the army camp in question has been withdrawn with immediate effect,"" read the ISPR statement issued yesterday. Meanwhile, the government has also ordered an urgent investigation. In a statement issued by the CA Press Wing, Muhammad Yunus condemned any form of custodial torture and extrajudicial killings, stating that upholding human rights in all aspects of national life remains a core mission of the administration, which includes some of the country's top rights activists. Touhidul was buried at his family graveyard after his funeral around 2:30pm yesterday. He was the convener of Jubo Dal's Panchthubi union unit. Touhidul used to work at a shipping company in Chattogram. He returned home on January 26 after his father's death. The family was supposed to hold a qulkhani on Friday. In the early hours of Friday, Touhidul was picked up from his home in Ittala village by men who identified themselves as members of the joint forces, said his wife. Later in the morning, Touhidul was found dead at Cumilla Medical College Hospital. Speaking to this newspaper on Friday, Mohinul Islam, officer-in-charge of Kotwali Police Station, said, ""The joint forces informed us around 11:00am that an injured man was found in Jhakunipara on the banks of the Gumti River. Police took Touhidul to Cumilla Medical College Hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead."" His body bore marks of trauma and injuries, according to an inquest report prepared by the Kotwali Police Station. However, Touhidul's family has yet to file a case. CONDEMNATIONS Different political parties and human rights organisations, including BNP, Bangladesher Samajtantrik Dal (BASOD), and Ain O Salish Kendra (ASK) have expressed concern and outrage over Touhidul's death. They stated that such incidents are a violation of human rights and the rule of law. They emphasised the need to identify those involved in the killing and ensure justice through a proper investigation. BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said, ""It's unfortunate that such extrajudicial killings are taking place during the tenure of an interim government supported by political parties participating in the democratic movement after the fall of the Awami fascist government in the student-public movement. This brutality reminds us of the Awami fascist era"" ""No government forces have the right to torture and kill anyone. No matter how powerful the perpetrator is, bringing them under the law and ensuring exemplary punishment is one of the conditions of the rule of law,"" Fakhrul said in a statement issued yesterday. Rights group Ain O Salish Kendra (ASK) also expressed concern over Touhidul's death. It demanded a trial of the culprits involved after a neutral probe. ""It's the state's duty to ensure the safety of a person detained by the state,"" ASK said in a statement, adding that such a kind of death is not acceptable at all. ASK urged authorities to take proper steps to ensure justice for the family and provide them with compensation.  "
20 Bangladeshis feared dead in Libya,"Twenty bodies, believed to be of Bangladeshis killed after a boat capsized in the Mediterranean near Brega of Libya last week, have been buried in the north African country. Bangladesh foreign ministry in a message to the media last night said no identification document was found on them and that the Red Crescent, which handled the burials, believes the victims were Bangladeshis. It said the bodies were buried in Ajdabiya, which is about 40km away from Brega on Friday, as they were decomposing. The incident occurred in an area under the jurisdiction of the Eastern Libyan Government, based in Benghazi. The Bangladesh embassy has yet to obtain the necessary clearance to visit the site, according to the ministry message. Meanwhile, Shariful Hasan, associate director (Migration and Youth Platform) of BRAC, in a social media post last night said most of the deceased were from Madaripur and Shariatpur, and some from Bhairab. He said this based on information from the Bangladesh embassy in Libya and the victims' families. ""According to my information, at least three more bodies may have washed up. There were at least 25 people in the group. I think two are alive, but I don't know where they are. It is unclear how the accident happened,"" he wrote. He said Bangladesh ranked first among countries whose nationals attempted to cross the Mediterranean in 2024. In the past year alone, 13,044 Bangladeshis were identified as taking this route. The Bangladesh embassy has not been able to confirm the number of Bangladeshis killed in last week's boat capsize. ""We have heard that several Bangladeshis may have died in the boat capsize, but we have no confirmation yet,"" an official of the embassy told The Daily Star last night. The official said once a clearance is obtained, a team from the embassy would travel to the area to gather information, identify the deceased, and facilitate repatriation of the bodies if those are of Bangladeshis. On January 30, the Bangladesh embassy in Libya on its Facebook page said several bodies of migrants had been recovered over the past two days from the shores of Brega. It said the bodies washed ashore after a boat carrying migrants capsized in the Mediterranean. The embassy urged anyone with information about Bangladeshis who may have died, been injured, or affected by the incident to come forward. Concerned individuals can contact the embassy via its Facebook page or official mobile numbers: +218916994202 and +218916994207."
Likely reform proposal: Govt officials may be able to retire after 15yrs,"For government employees, voluntary retirement with pension benefits currently requires 25 years of service. The Public Administration Reform Commission is set to recommend lowering the requirement to 15 years. The commission is also likely to recommend doing away with a legal provision that allows the authorities to force employees to retire after they have been on the job for 25 years or more, said multiple sources in the commission. Sections 44 and 45 of the Government Service Act-2018 would need to be amended in order to implement these recommendations. The Public Administration Reform Commission held a meeting yesterday to finalise the recommendations. It will hand the chief adviser the recommendation on February 5, which is the new deadline for the submission. ""Currently, if a government employee voluntarily retires before 25 years in service, they do not get pension benefits. This is why the commission is recommending the change,"" said a source. However, those retiring after 15 years will not get the full pension benefits, for which one must be on the job for 25 years. No commission member is willing to explain on record the rationale behind the recommendations. ""Officers often receive better job offers in the private sector. Unless they have been on the job for 25 years, they often do not take those opportunities because they do not want to lose their pension benefits. We want to change that."" As to why the government should not be allowed to force someone to retire, another source said, ""An officer should not be afraid of forced retirement for disagreeing with the government or having a history of being a member of an opposition party."" But if an employee does something wrong, the authorities can launch departmental procedure and force them to retire. ""But such retirement should not be forced under the pretext of public interest."" The option of voluntary retirement after 15 years is an opportunity for some. A joint secretary who worked at the Prime Minister's Office when the Awami league was in power, said, ""I have lost the enthusiasm for work. I got the job by obtaining brilliant results. I worked in important positions because of my ability to work well. But now I am labelled as a fascist collaborator. If they implement the recommendations, I will retire and leave the country."" Another source in the commission said the recommendations were not designed to give advantage to a particular group. ""In the past, recommendations of various commissions were rejected. As this commission was formed after a mass uprising, we hope the government will implement its recommendations. ""We strongly recommend stopping the current practice of giving promotions to more officers than there are posts. Those who do not get promotions will have the opportunity to leave the service after 15 years and move on."" The commission may propose reducing the time an officer gets to provide information sought under the Right to Information Act. it may also propose increasing the penalties under the act. Public administration researcher and former secretary AKM Abdul Awal Majumder said, ""In the armed forces, there is an opportunity for retirement after 15 years. Most officers cannot advance further after a major promotion, so they voluntarily retire and join other work. However, I don't think this opportunity will be taken by many in the civil administration. But if the option is there, I don't see any harm."" The commission will recommend lowering the number of ministries and divisions to 25 to 30 from the current 55. The Economic Strategy Redefinition Task Force has already recommended merging the road, rail, water, and air transport ministries. The commission may recommend not allowing officials of one institution to work in another on deputation. It may recommend promotions to the rank of deputy secretary based on the Senior Service Pool (SSP) Order-1979. The SSP initiative was taken during President Ziaur Rahman's tenure. It was not implemented by the HM Ershad government. In that case, opportunities for administration cadre promotions to the rank of deputy secretary may be more limited. However, the commission is also going to recommend reserving 50 percent of the positions for administration cadre promotions to the rank of deputy secretary."
Installation ceremony of IAB Chattogram held,"The 12th installation ceremony of the Institute of Architects Bangladesh (IAB) Chattogram Chapter was held in the port city on Saturday. The event was held at Chattogram Club's Auditorium. Attending as the chief guest, Chattogram Development Authority Chairman Md Nurul Karim said, ""The port city has a unique combination of sea, river and hills. But the city is losing its unique features gradually due to unplanned development."" ""The environment we saw in Chattogram in our childhood is no longer there. But if we want, we can restore this city to its former self,"" Nurul Karim said. He also urged architects to protect the environment during planning. ""We have already formed a board of the CDA with professionals including architects and civil engineers."" ""We need development. So, everyone must work on development while protecting the environment,"" he added. Later, Fazle Imran Chowdhury, chairman; Adar Yusuf, deputy chairman; Mohammad Asaduzzaman Chowdhury, secretary, and other six members of the 12th committee took oath. An exhibition was also held where several architectural designs were displayed."
Taiwan bans government agencies from using DeepSeek,"Taiwan has banned workers in the public sector and at key infrastructure facilities from using DeepSeek, saying it was a Chinese product and could endanger national security. DeepSeek launched its R1 chatbot last month, claiming it matches the capacity of artificial intelligence pace-setters in the United States for a fraction of the investment. Countries including South Korea, Ireland, France, Australia and Italy have raised questions about the Chinese AI startup's data practices. Taiwan's Ministry of Digital Affairs said Friday all government agencies and critical infrastructure should not use DeepSeek because it ""endangers national information security"". ""DeepSeek AI service is a Chinese product,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""Its operation involves cross-border transmission and information leakage and other information security concerns."" Taiwan has long accused China of using ""grey zone"" tactics -- actions that fall short of an act of war -- against the island, including cyberattacks, as Beijing presses its claims of sovereignty over the island. Since 2019, Taiwan has banned government agencies from using information and communication technology products and services that pose a threat to ""national information security"". DeepSeek sparked panic on Wall Street this week with its powerful new chatbot that is thought to have matched US companies in its abilities but at a fraction of the cost. That's despite a strict US regime prohibiting Chinese firms from accessing the kinds of advanced chips needed to power the massive learning models used to develop AI. Taiwan's restriction came as data watchdogs in South Korea and Ireland said they would ask DeepSeek to clarify how it manages users' personal information. Earlier this week, Italy launched an investigation into the R1 model and blocked it from processing Italian users' data."
Myanmar Conflict / Military extends emergency for  six months,"Myanmar's ruling military has extended a state of emergency for another six months, state media reported yesterday, a day ahead of the four-year anniversary of a coup that plunged the country into chaos after a decade of tentative democracy. Myanmar has been locked in a civil war triggered by the military's overthrow of the elected civilian government of Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi. The junta plans this year to hold an election, which critics have derided as a sham to keep the generals in power through proxies. ""There are still more tasks to be done to hold the general election successfully. Especially for a free and fair election, stability and peace is still needed,"" state-run Myanmar Digital News said on its Telegram channel in announcing the extension of emergency rule. The ruling military council headed by army chief Min Aung Hlaing unanimously approved the extension, the junta's information team said in a statement. Elections cannot be held under a state of emergency, so long-promised polls the junta has said will be held in 2025 will not take place until the second half of the year at the earliest. Min Aung Hlaing told the ruling council that ""peace and stability is still needed"" before the state of emergency can be lifted and polls held. Critics and Western governments have said that any elections held under the auspices of the junta will be neither free nor fair. The military seized power after making unsubstantiated allegations of fraud in 2020 elections which Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won in a landslide."
Arakan Army disrupts trade with Myanmar,"Cross-border trade between Bangladesh and Myanmar through Teknaf Land Port is in disarray as the Arakan Army, a Myanmar-based rebel group, disrupts ship movement along the Naf river estuary. With cargo being seized, intensified border tensions, and dwindling imports and exports, traders warn that the once-thriving trade route may soon be completely halted. On January 16, the Arakan Army seized three cargo ships travelling from Yangon to Teknaf. While two ships were released on January 20, one remains in their custody. ""We don't know the exact reason for the seizure,"" said Ehteshamul Haque Bahadur, general secretary of the Teknaf Land Port C&F Agents Association. The rebel group that controls much of the 270km border with Bangladesh has imposed an unwritten embargo on ship movement along the Naf estuary. Bahadur expressed concern over the disruption of trade. ""If this situation persists, traders may be forced to abandon their businesses in Teknaf. Resolving this requires collective efforts."" Importer Shawkat Ali, whose goods are on the seized ship, said yesterday that the Arakan Army is inspecting vessels on the Myanmar's territorial waters that are under their control. Some goods from Myanmar are being imported through Chattogram Port. Shawkat, however, said using the Chattogram Port significantly increases costs and causes delays. ""Shipping goods via Teknaf takes five to seven days, while via Chattogram requires at least a month."" A businessman, wishing not to be named, claimed that the Arakan Army is holding one ship hostage as it belongs to an associate of a high-ranking Myanmar military officer. ""The seizure seems intended to put pressure on the junta. The Arakan Army is also trying to secure a share of the cross-border trade."" Jasim Uddin, general manager of Teknaf Land Port, the only private land port in the country, highlighted the sharp decline in trade since November 2023. ""Before then, around 50 cargo ships docked every day. But after the fighting intensified along the Bangladesh-Myanmar border, the number dropped. Since July 2024, when the fighting reached Maungdaw township, only three to five ships have been arriving each month,"" he said. Port officials said three ships had to wait for several days to return to Myanmar from Teknaf due to threats from the Arakan Army. Lt Col Ashiqur Rahman, commanding officer of Bangladesh Border Guard 2 Battalion in Teknaf, said they were not formally informed of the issue. No business representative reported it. ""The incident occurred in the Myanmar waters with Myanmar vessels, so there is nothing we can do about it."" The BGB official assured that they are ensuring the security of Bangladeshi people along the border. DECLINE IN TRADE Trade through Teknaf Land Port has significantly dropped over the last two fiscal years, according to data from Teknaf Customs. In the 2022-23 fiscal year, 1,88,999 tonnes of goods worth Tk 1,545 crore were imported from Myanmar, while Bangladesh exported 2,941 tonnes of goods worth Tk 6.72 crore. However, in 2023-24 fiscal year, imports dropped to 71,741 tonnes, valued at approximately Tk 808 crore. Exports also saw a significant decline, with only 704 tonnes of goods worth Tk 2.45 crore. In the first six months of the current fiscal year, Bangladesh imported 11,129 tonnes of goods worth around Tk 113 crore through Teknaf Port. During the same period, 636 tonnes of goods valued at approximately Tk 64 lakh were exported to Myanmar. The imported items include dry fish, frozen fish, betel nuts, onions, ginger, coconuts, wood, and other goods. Bangladesh's main exports to Myanmar are cement and potatoes. Contacted, a foreign ministry official told The Daily Star that the ministry was not in a position to contact the Arakan Army. Bangladesh maintains formal communication with the Myanmar Army governing the country. ""We hope that the Arakan Army will release the ship for their own interest."" Asked about the slump in the trade, the official, who preferred anonymity, said the trade between the two countries is not that significant for Bangladesh."
75 Rohingya refugees blocked from landing on Indonesia beach,"At least 75 Rohingya refugees arrived by boat at a tourist beach in western Indonesia yesterday, but were stopped by authorities from disembarking, local officials said. The mostly Muslim Rohingyas are heavily persecuted in Myanmar -- their predominantly Buddhist homeland -- and thousands risk their lives each year on long and dangerous sea journeys to reach Malaysia or Indonesia. The latest group of refugees, including four children, arrived on a beach in Aceh at 2:00 pm, according to Rizalihadi, a local administrative official who like many Indonesians goes by one name. ""There are 75 Rohingya Muslims who landed on the Leuge Beach. Four of them are toddlers,"" Rizalihadi told reporters. ""For now, they are not allowed to disembark, considering today is a public holiday... There are concerns that they might blend in with the crowd and escape,"" Rizalihadi said."
Japan sees record number of teen suicides,"Japan saw a record number of suicides among school pupils in 2024, health ministry data showed yesterday. The latest data among those in elementary through high school edged up to 527 from 513 cases in 2023, the ministry said. The total number of people of all ages dying by suicide fell 7.2 percent to 20,268, sharply lower from the record high of 34,427 cases in 2003. The number among people aged younger than 20, including those at school, also fell to 800 in 2024 from 810 in 2023, the latest data showed. ""We regard this very seriously,"" Keiichiro Tachibana, deputy chief cabinet secretary, told a regular press briefing. ""We will continue do our utmost to take measures to protect children's lives and to realise a society where no one is pressed into taking their own life."" The health ministry was expected to issue its analysis of the data in March after more figures become available. Japan annually sees the number of teen suicides rise at the end of every summer break in late August through early September. This prompts the government and media to heighten public calls for struggling teens to seek help."
"India, China agree to resume flights 5yrs after stoppage","India and China yesterday announced they have agreed to resume direct air services after about five years, indicating a thaw in relations between the two neighbours after a military clash on their unresolved border across the Himalayas in 2020. Both sides will negotiate a framework on the flights in a meeting that will be held at an ""early date,"" the Indian External Affairs Ministry said in a statement after a meeting between India's top diplomat and his Chinese counterpart in Beijing. ""The relevant technical authorities on the two sides will meet and negotiate an updated framework for this purpose at an early date,"" the statement said. A deadly hand-to-hand combat between Indian and Chinese troops in the Galwan river valley in the Himalayas in May 2020 left 20 Indians and an unspecified number of PLA soldiers dead, sending bilateral ties into a nosedive. The two countries also agreed to hold an early meeting of the India-China expert-level mechanism to discuss the resumption of the provision of hydrological data and other cooperation pertaining to trans-border rivers, it said. This assumes significance in the wake of concerns in India over China's decision to build a huge dam on the trans-border river Yarlung Tsangpo, which is known by the name Brahmaputra in India and Bangladesh. There is concern in both India and Bangladesh that the dam by China will hit the flow of water in the lower riparian region. Yesterday's announcements followed Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri's two-day visit to Beijing on January 26-27 for a meeting with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong. The two sides also decided to resume the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra in Tibet, a Hindu pilgrimage centre, in the summer of 2025, and the relevant mechanism will discuss the modalities for doing so as per existing agreements. The two countries also agreed to take ""appropriate"" measures to further promote and facilitate people-to-people exchanges, including media and think-tank interactions."
Martial law decree: S Korea’s Yoon indicted for insurrection,"South Korea's prosecutors yesterday indicted impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on charges of leading an insurrection with his short-lived imposition of martial law on December 3, the main opposition party said. The charges are unprecedented for a South Korean president, and if convicted, Yoon could face years in prison for his shock martial law decree, which sought to ban political and parliamentary activity and control the media. His move set off a wave of political upheaval in Asia's fourth-largest economy and a top US ally, with the prime minister also impeached and suspended from power and a number of top military officials indicted for their roles in the alleged insurrection. The prosecutors' office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The indictment was also reported by South Korean media. Anti-corruption investigators last week recommended charging the jailed Yoon, who was impeached by parliament and suspended from his duties on December 14. A former top prosecutor himself, Yoon has been in solitary confinement since becoming the first sitting president to be arrested on January 15 after days of defiant, armed standoff between his security detail and arresting officials. Over the weekend a court twice refused prosecutors' request to extend his detention while they conducted further investigation, but with the charges they have again requested that he be kept in custody, media reports said. Yoon's lawyers had urged the prosecutors to release him immediately from what they call illegal custody. Insurrection is one of the few criminal charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity. It is punishable by life imprisonment or death, although South Korea has not executed anyone in decades."
Voluntary repatriation of North Korean POWs in Ukraine,"With new reports of North Korean troops captured as POWs in Ukraine, as resident Zelensky puts it, there is now ""irrefutable evidence"" that North Korea has been involved in Russia's war against Ukraine. The ROK's National Intelligence Service provides that North Korea deployed around 12,000 soldiers in Kursk Oblast, and at least 300 soldiers have been killed and 2700 wounded. Among them, two were captured as POWs by the Ukraine government, and President Zelensky proposed that he is ready to exchange captured North Korean POWs with Ukrainian POWs in Russia. And if exchanges do take place, it is likely that North Korean POWs will be returned to North Korea, but President Zelensky did leave the option open for the soldiers not to be return to North Korea if the ""soldiers express a desire to bring peace closer by spreading the truth about the war in Korean"". As for the POWs, they have not provided a clear position, but in an interview posted by President Zelensky, one of the POWs said he wanted to return to North Korea while the other mentioned that he would like to stay in Ukraine, but would return home if it was required for him to do so. While the Third Geneva Convention, which regulates POWs, does stipulate that POWs should be returned to their homeland, many human rights organizations are concerned about their possible return to North Korea since these POWs can face serious human rights risks if they are sent back to North Korea. The Third Geneva Convention clearly provides that POWs should be treated humanely at all times, and therefore, the Ukraine government is now cooperating with the UN and the ICRC and other organizations to protect the POWs from violence, public humiliation, or insult. But if they are repatriated to North Korea, it is highly likely that they can be punished for not obeying military orders. In particular, captured North Korea soldiers may be deemed to be traitors since reports show that North Korea authorities instructed these soldiers to commit suicide or self-destruction before being captured by the enemy. They may also be punished for consuming foreign media, which can lead to arbitrary detention and even torture. Many North Korean defectors already face serious consequences when they are repatriated, which is why the UN is calling for states not to forcibly repatriate North Korea defectors in accordance with the principle of non-refoulement under international law. In the meantime, the ROK government has not provided an official position on this issue, and a spokesperson rather announced that return of North Korean POWs ""requires review of international law and other legal matters, and consultation with other related countries"". But as a matter of law, North Korean POWs are entitled to go to the ROK based on ROK's constitutional law since North Korean citizens are considered to be South Korean citizens under the ROK's constitution. It is under this legal basis that North Korean defectors are able to enter South Korea. However, the challenge lies in that North Korea and Russia have not officially acknowledged the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia, and possibilities remain that Russia will claim the North Korea POWs as their own soldiers. Therefore, many uncertainties remain, but it is clear that the free will of the North Korean POWs should be respected. In fact, it was during the Korean War, when this free will or 'voluntary repatriation' of Korean POWs was implemented for the first time. At the end of the war, a large number of communist POWs did not want to return to North Korea or China because they feared they would be punished or killed for being captured or cooperating with the UN. Due to such risks, President Truman at that time acknowledged the need for ""voluntary repatriation"", claiming that forced repatriation would be repugnant to the fundamental moral and humanitarian principles. These same principles should be applied to the North Korean POWs in Ukraine today considering the dangers they will face when they go back to their homeland.

Taliban reject ICC move to arrest top officials,"Afghanistan's Taliban government said yesterday an arrest warrant sought by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for its leaders was ""politically motivated"". It comes a day after the ICC chief prosecutor said he was seeking warrants against senior Taliban leaders in Afghanistan over the persecution of women –- a crime against humanity. ""Like many other decisions of the (ICC), it is devoid of a fair legal basis, is a matter of double standards and is politically motivated,"" said a statement from the Foreign Ministry posted on social media platform X. ""It is regrettable that this institution has turned a blind eye to war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by foreign forces and their domestic allies during the twenty-year occupation of Afghanistan."" It said the court should ""not attempt to impose a particular interpretation of human rights on the entire world and ignore the religious and national values of people of the rest of the world""."
German ex-president Horst Koehler dead at 81,"Germany's former president Horst Koehler, who served as head of state from 2004 to 2010, died on Saturday aged 81 after a brief illness, officials announced. ""With the death of Horst Koehler, we have lost a highly esteemed and extremely popular person who achieved great things –- for our country and in the world,"" President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in a letter to Koehler's widow. Koehler, an economist by training, was the first German president who was not a career politician. Before becoming president he was the head of the International Monetary Fund in Washington. He became German president, a mostly ceremonial role, after being put forward by then opposition leader Angela Merkel, who went on to become chancellor. He was elected for a second term in 2009 but in May the following year resigned after being criticised over remarks about overseas German military missions. He died in Berlin early Saturday after a short, serious illness surrounded by his family, the presidency said."
18 Pakistan paramilitaries killed in ambush,"Eighteen paramilitaries were killed and three others seriously wounded in an attack in Pakistan's southwest Balochistan province, police and local officials told AFP on Saturday. A vehicle ""carrying unarmed Frontier Corps paramilitaries"" near the town of Mangochar ""came under gunfire from 70 to 80 armed assailants who had blocked the road"", a police official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity. The overnight attack killed 17 of the passengers and a paramilitary who came to their aid, he said, confirming reports from local sources. Three other paramilitaries were seriously wounded and two escaped unharmed, he said. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack so far. Security forces have been battling sectarian, ethnic and separatist violence for decades in impoverished but mineral-rich Balochistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran. There has been an increase in attacks in the volatile province in recent months, with six people killed in a bombing in January claimed by the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA). The BLA frequently claims deadly attacks against security forces or Pakistanis from other provinces, notably Punjabis in Balochistan. The militants have also targeted energy projects with foreign financing -- most notably from China -- accusing outsiders of exploiting the resource-rich region while excluding residents in the poorest part of Pakistan. In November, the BLA claimed responsibility for a bombing at Quetta's main railway station that killed 26 people, including 14 soldiers. The group also claimed responsibility for coordinated attacks by dozens of assailants in August that killed at least 39 people, one of the highest tolls in the region. A similarly dramatic uptick in attacks has also been witnessed elsewhere in Pakistan in recent months, including in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. In 2024 alone, the military reported 383 soldiers and 925 militants killed in various clashes."
Hamas frees three Israeli hostages in fourth ceasefire swap,"Ranks of Hamas fighters formed up on Gaza's beachfront on Saturday for the handover of an Israeli-American hostage in a show of force against the dramatic backdrop of breaking waves. In Gaza City a stage had been erected at a harbour for the handover of Keith Siegel. Green Hamas and Palestinian flags flapped in a strong sea breeze near a fisherman's wharf. Earlier, Israeli Yarden Bibas and Franco-Israeli Ofer Kalderon were handed over in a swift and organised ceremony in the war-battered city of Khan Yunis to the south. Siegel, 65, wore a black tracksuit and dark-grey hat as he was escorted quickly to the stage by fighters. He waved to onlookers and cameras, as hostages being freed have been told to do by their captors, before being handed over to the Red Cross. The occupational therapist seized from his home, along with his wife Aviva who was released during a truce in November 2023, appeared to have some difficulty moving as he mounted the stage. Before Siegel's release, ordered lines of scores of heavily armed fighters, only their eyes visible through masks, flanked the platform. On a row of pickups, some fighters carried RPGs (rocket-propelled-grenades) and other weapons. Slain commanders On the platform itself, Palestine fighters held up portraits of the group's slain leaders including Mohammed Deif, its military chief accused by Israel of being one of the masterminds behind the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel and whose death was confirmed by Hamas on Thursday. ""We are the men of Mohammed Deif,"" the Hamas fighters chanted as they brandished their weapons. Ahead of the two exchanges in Khan Yunis in southern Gaza and Gaza City to the north, scores of Hamas fighters, most wearing military fatigues, stood guard, apparently to control onlookers. The arrangements for Saturday's hostage release appeared in stark contrast with scenes during Thursday's exchange in Khan Yunis, which was condemned by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Only after Siegel had left the handover site in a Red Cross vehicle were crowds permitted to move towards the stage. Onlookers, many of them children, paused to take selfies with Hamas fighters and mingled in the port, waving Palestinian flags. Bibas and Kalderon were handed over quickly in devastated Khan Yunis, where many buildings have been destroyed in 15 months of war between Israel and Palestinian fighters. Handover formalities Bibas, the father of the two youngest hostages -- Kfir, whose second birthday fell in January, and his older brother Ariel, who turned five in August -- was urged to wave to a Hamas cameraman as he held a certificate confirming his release. The 35-year-old, whose wife and two children Hamas has declared dead, although Israel has not confirmed their deaths, frowned as he took to the stage and looked straight ahead during the now familiar handover formalities endured by other hostages being released. Kalderon, 54, seized along with his son Erez, 12, and daughter Sahar, 16, from Nir Oz kibbutz and who were released in a first truce last year, wore a military-green tracksuit as he took to the stage. He too was instructed to wave before he joined the Red Cross officials. An assault rifle, apparently captured from Israeli forces during the fighting in Gaza, had been placed on the table where Red Cross officials exchanged paperwork with a Hamas official to verify that the two men had changed hands."
"Musk aides lock govt workers out of computer systems at US agency, sources say","Aides to Elon Musk charged with running the US government human resources agency have locked career civil servants out of computer systems that contain the personal data of millions of federal employees, according to two agency officials. Since taking office 11 days ago, President Donald Trump has embarked on a massive government makeover, firing and sidelining hundreds of civil servants in his first steps toward downsizing the bureaucracy and installing more loyalists. Musk, the billionaire Tesla TSLA.O CEO and X owner tasked by Trump to slash the size of the 2.2 million-strong civilian government workforce, has moved swiftly to install allies at the agency known as the Office of Personnel Management. The two officials, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said some senior career employees at OPM have had their access revoked to some of the department's data systems. The systems include a vast database called Enterprise Human Resources Integration, which contains dates of birth, Social Security numbers, appraisals, home addresses, pay grades and length of service of government workers, the officials said. ""We have no visibility into what they are doing with the computer and data systems,"" one of the officials said. ""That is creating great concern. There is no oversight. It creates real cybersecurity and hacking implications."" Officials affected by the move can still log on and access functions such as email but can no longer see the massive datasets that cover every facet of the federal workforce. Musk, OPM, representatives of the new team, and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. OPM has sent out memos that eschew the normal dry wording of government missives as it encourages civil servants to consider buyout offers to quit and take a vacation to a ""dream destination."" Don Moynihan, a professor at the Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, said the actions inside OPM raised concerns about congressional oversight at the agency and how Trump and Musk view the federal bureaucracy. ""This makes it much harder for anyone outside Musk's inner circle at OPM to know what's going on,"" Moynihan said. MUSK INFLUENCE A team including current and former employees of Musk assumed command of OPM on Jan. 20, the day Trump took office. They have moved sofa beds onto the fifth floor of the agency's headquarters, which contains the director's office and can only be accessed with a security badge or a security escort, one of the OPM employees said. The sofa beds have been installed so the team can work around the clock, the employee said. Musk, a major donor to a famously demanding boss, installed beds at X for employees to enable them to work longer when in 2022 he took over the social media platform, formerly known as Twitter. ""It feels like a hostile takeover,"" the employee said. The new appointees in charge of OPM have moved the agency's chief management officer, Katie Malague, out of her office and to a new office on a different floor, the officials said. Malague did not respond to a request for comment. The moves by Musk's aides at OPM, and upheaval inside the Treasury building caused by other Musk aides that was reported on Friday, underscore the sweeping influence Musk is having across government. David Lebryk, the top-ranking career US Treasury Department official, is set to leave his post following a clash with allies of Musk after they asked for access to payment systems, the Washington Post reported on Friday. The new team at OPM includes software engineers and Brian Bjelde, who joined Musk's SpaceX venture in 2003 as an avionics engineer before rising to become the company's vice president of human resources. Bjelde's role at OPM is that of a senior adviser. The acting head of OPM, Charles Ezell, has been sending memos to the entire government workforce since Trump took office, including Tuesday's offering federal employees the chance to quit with eight months pay. ""No-one here knew that the memos were coming out. We are finding out about these memos the same time as the rest of the world,"" one of the officials said. Among the group that now runs OPM is Amanda Scales, a former Musk employee, who is now OPM's chief of staff. In some memos sent out on Jan. 20 and Jan. 21 by Ezell, including one directing agencies to identify federal workers on probationary periods, agency heads were asked to email Scales at her OPM email address. Another senior adviser is Riccardo Biasini, a former engineer at Tesla and most recently a director at The Boring Company, Musk's tunnel-building operation in Las Vegas."
Trump's Pentagon says it will 'rotate' out some media from offices,"US President Donald Trump's administration, in an unprecedented move, announced late on Friday it would remove four media organizations including the New York Times from their dedicated office spaces in the Pentagon, citing a desire to make room for others. The memo on a ""New Annual Media Rotation Program"" said it would also remove National Public Radio, Comcast Corp-owned NBC News and Politico, which must vacate their spaces by Feb. 14. In their place, it would give dedicated office space to the New York Post, One America News Network, Breitbart News Network and HuffPost News. Each year going forward, one outlet from print, online, television and radio will rotate out of the Pentagon ""to allow a new outlet from the same medium that has not had the unique opportunity to report as a resident member of the Pentagon Press Corps,"" the memo said. ""We're disappointed by the decision to deny us access to a broadcasting booth at the Pentagon that we've used for many decades,"" an NBC News spokesperson said by email. ""Despite the significant obstacles this presents to our ability to gather and report news in the national public interest, we will continue to report with the same integrity and rigor NBC News always has."" The Times, Politico and NPR did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside regular business hours. More than two dozen news organizations operate out of the Pentagon, including Reuters, reporting on the daily activities of the US military. ""To be clear, the outlets that vacate the spaces loaned them by the Secretary (of Defense) will remain full members of the Pentagon Press Corps,"" said John Ullyot, acting assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs. ""The only change will be giving up their physical work spaces in the building to allow new outlets to have their turn to become resident members of the Pentagon Press Corps."" The Pentagon Press Association, which represents journalists who cover the Defense Department, said it was ""greatly troubled by this unprecedented move by DOD to single out highly professional media."" Reuters correspondent Phil Stewart is a member of the association's four-member board of directors."
Three Israeli hostages set to be released in latest Gaza exchange,"The Palestinian fighter group Hamas is expected to hand over three Israelis on Saturday, in the latest stage of a gradual exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners under a truce aimed at opening the way to ending the 15-month war in Gaza. The three Israelis include Yarden Bibas, father of the two youngest hostages, baby Kfir, only 9 months old when he was kidnapped by Hamas-led gunmen on Oct. 7, 2023, and Ariel, who was 4 at the time of the cross-border attack. Hamas said in November 2023 that the boys and their mother Shiri, who was taken at the same time, were killed in an Israeli airstrike. There has been no word on them since. US-Israeli dual national Keith Siegel and French-Israeli dual national Ofer Kalderon will also be part of the exchange for 182 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, Hamas said. Saturday is also expected to see the first Palestinians travelling from Gaza to Egypt through the newly reopened Rafah crossing. It will be opened initially for 50 injured fighters and 50 wounded civilians, along with the people escorting them, with a further 100 people, most likely students, probably allowed through on humanitarian grounds. Fifteen of the 33 hostages due for release in the first stage of the ceasefire have so far been released in exchange for 400 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Negotiations are due to start by Tuesday on agreements for the release of more than 60 remaining hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza in a second phase of the deal. The initial six-week ceasefire, agreed with Egyptian and Qatari mediators and backed by the United States, has so far stayed on track despite a number of incidents that have led both sides to accuse the other of violating the deal. The Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023 killed some 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostage, according to Israeli figures. Israel's campaign in response has destroyed much of the densely populated Gaza Strip and killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health authorities."
"Trump: Nothing Canada, Mexico or China can do to delay Feb 1 tariffs","US President Donald Trump said on Friday he would impose hefty new tariffs of 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada and 10% on imports from China, and nothing could be done by the three countries to forestall them. Trump did, however, reference a potential carve out for oil from Canada, saying that rate would be 10% versus the 25% planned for other goods from the United States' northern neighbor. But he indicated wider tariffs on oil and natural gas would be coming in mid-February, remarks that sent oil prices higher. Trump has been threatening the tariffs for weeks, saying they would be imposed on Feb. 1 and remain in place until the countries did more to stem the flow of both migrants and fentanyl over the US border. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office as he was signing executive orders, Trump said he understood the duties could result in higher costs being passed on to consumers and acknowledged his actions may cause disruptions in the short term. Most economists estimate such sweeping import taxes, and the likely retaliation, would disrupt economic activity around the globe. Asked if there was any opportunity at this stage for the three top US trading partners to win a delay, Trump said: ""No, no. Not right now, no."" He brushed away the notion his threats for levies have been a bargaining tool. ""No, it's not ... we have big (trade) deficits with, as you know, with all three of them."" ""It's something we're doing, and we'll possibly very substantially increase it, or not, we'll see how it is,"" Trump said. ""But it's a lot of money coming to the United States."" And more tariffs are on the way, the Republican president said, saying import taxes were being considered on European goods as well as on steel, aluminum and copper, and on drugs and semiconductors. ""We're going to be putting tariffs on steel and aluminum, and ultimately copper. Copper will take a little longer,"" he said. Financial markets have been whipsawed by the rapid-fire but still not fully clear developments on Trump's tariff plans, with currency trading showing particular volatility. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso both weakened while Treasury bond yields rose, and stocks ended the day lower. Still, he said he was not concerned about the reaction of financial markets to his plans to impose tariffs. ""The President will be implementing tomorrow 25% tariffs on Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canada, and a 10% tariff on China for the illegal fentanyl that they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country, which has killed tens of millions of Americans,"" White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told a press briefing. Leavitt said details of the tariffs will be released sometime on Saturday. When Trump imposed punitive duties on Chinese goods in 2018 and 2019, there was typically a lag of two to three weeks for Customs and Border Protection to begin collecting tariffs, due to computer system updates and notices required for importers. Trump traveled late on Friday to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, saying he would work all weekend there. He was joined on the flight by his commerce secretary nominee Howard Lutnick, who Trump has designated as his trade policy chief. MAJOR DISRUPTION Economists and business executives have warned the tariffs would spark increases in the prices of imports such as aluminum and lumber from Canada, as well as fruits, vegetables, beer and electronics from Mexico and motor vehicles from both countries. Trump again spoke of collecting hundreds of billions of dollars in revenues from other countries, but economists generally say tariffs are paid by firms that import goods and pass the costs on to consumers or accept lower profits. ""President Trump's tariffs will tax America first,"" said Matthew Holmes, public policy chief at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. ""From higher costs at the pumps, grocery stores and online checkout, tariffs cascade through the economy and end up hurting consumers and businesses on both sides of the border."" Trump's move is expected to draw retaliatory tariffs, potentially disrupting more than $2.1 trillion in annual two-way US trade with the three trading partners. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday said Canada would immediately respond with forceful countermeasures, adding Canadians could be ""facing difficult times in the coming days and weeks."" Canada has drawn up detailed targets for immediate tariff retaliation, including duties on Florida orange juice, a source familiar with the plan said. Canada has a broader list of targets that could reach C$150 billion ($105 billion) worth of US imports, but would hold public consultations before acting, the source said. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she would ""wait with a cool head"" for Trump's tariff decision and was prepared to continue a border dialogue. Sheinbaum previously said Mexico also would retaliate, arguing Trump's tariffs would cost 400,000 US jobs and drive up prices for US consumers. China has been more circumspect about its retaliation plans, but has vowed to respond. China ""firmly opposes"" Trump's new duties, a spokesperson for Beijing's embassy in Washington said, adding: ""There is no winner in a trade war or tariff war, which serves the interests of neither side nor the world."""
WASHINGTON CRASH / Investigators try to salvage aircraft,"Investigators yesterday pushed forward with efforts to retrieve the two aircraft involved in a crash in Washington that killed 67 people and raised questions about air safety in the US capital. Fresh from recovering the so-called black boxes from the American Airlines plane that crashed into the Potomac River after colliding with an Army Black Hawk helicopter on Wednesday, divers aim to ""salvage the aircraft"" and find additional components, Washington's fire department said. ""Overnight, boats will remain on scene for security and surface searches from local, state, and federal regional partners,"" it said. The National Transportation Safety Board is studying the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder from the CRJ700 airplane, which carried 60 passengers and four crew members, all of whom perished in the crash. The three members of the helicopter crew also died. The board said it will have preliminary report into disaster within 30 days. Authorities have not pinpointed a reason for the collision. The military said the maximum altitude for the route the helicopter was taking is 200 feet (61 meters) but it may have been flying higher. The collision occurred at an altitude of around 300 feet, according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24. Senator Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, questioned the safety of military and commercial flights separated by as little as 350 feet (107 m) vertically and horizontally."
Two killed in Israeli strikes on east Lebanon,"Overnight Israeli air strikes on the Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon killed two people, the health ministry said yesterday, two months into a fragile ceasefire. ""The strike by the Israeli enemy on Janta killed two people and wounded 10,"" the ministry said. The Israeli military said it struck ""multiple"" Hezbollah targets in the Bekaa, a stronghold of the militant group with which it fought a war last year. ""The targets that were struck include a Hezbollah terrorist site containing underground infrastructure, used to develop and manufacture weaponry and additional terrorist infrastructure sites on the Syrian-Lebanese border used by Hezbollah to smuggle weaponry into Lebanon,"" the military said in a statement. The village of Janta area lies close to the Syrian border and the area was already hit by Israeli strikes on January 13. The overnight strikes came after the Israeli military said it had intercepted a Hezbollah surveillance drone approaching Israeli airspace on Thursday, in a ""breach of the ceasefire understandings between Israel and Lebanon""."
Turkey court jails opposition journalist,"A court in Turkey yesterday ordered the arrest of a journalist from an opposition television channel accused of broadcasting a secretly recorded interview with a state official, the media outlet said. Halk TV said its editor-in-chief Suat Toktas had been jailed because he made the decision to broadcast an interview about an investigation into Istanbul's opposition mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. ""I am accused of ridiculous allegations,"" Toktas told the court, according to the television outlet. ""What we have done is a true journalism."" Halk TV is is close to the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP)."
70 Rohingyas land in Indonesia’s Aceh,"More than 70 Rohingyas came ashore in Indonesia's Aceh province, an official said yesterday, the latest wave of Rohingyas who often faced rejection from Indonesia's regional communities. A wooden boat carrying 40 men, 32 women, and four children landed in Pereulak region in East Aceh on Wednesday, Nova Suryandaru, the head of regional police, told Reuters. The boat had arrived at the beach in the afternoon but the Rohingya's attempts to land were rejected by residents. They were finally allowed to land at around 8:00 pm. ""The boat was deliberately damaged by them (Rohingyas)... So, we negotiated with the residents, explaining that it's impossible for the boat to sail again,"" said Nova, adding they were evacuated to temporary shelters."
"‘No room for politics under AL name, ideology’","As the interim government is going to complete its six months in office, calls for the national election are growing louder. Several reform commissions have already submitted their reports, and the government may soon engage with political parties. Nahid Islam, a July uprising leader, who is now serving as an adviser to the interim government, lately spoke with The Daily Star's Wasim Bin Habib and Baharam Khan on a range of pressing issues. TDS:How would you evaluate the six months since the interim government took office? Nahid: We assumed responsibilities in an extraordinary situation and have been navigating a kind of revolutionary phase. It was an unprecedented situation for Bangladesh. Naturally, there was tension and uncertainty. However, over the past six months, the situation has become more stable. Although progress is slow, things are improving. People may have expected faster actions, but various constraints posed limitations. Despite these, the government is doing its best. TDS:What were the main challenges during this time? Nahid: The biggest challenges were maintaining law and order and stabilising the prices of essentials. Ensuring national unity while meeting people's expectations has always been a challenge. As everyone can see, the government's structure is small, but it's work scope is quite extensive. We've to move forwards by maintaining a balance among political parties while keeping national unity intact. Meanwhile, the reform commissions are submitting their reports. begun, with arrests already underway. So, I believe we're making progress. If the political parties show more goodwill, we can advance at a faster pace. TDS: What were the things you wanted to achieve during this period but couldn't? Nahid: There are some regrets. If we could take some stricter measures from the very beginning, changes could have come sooner. Over these six months, we haven't been able to improve the administrative and law and order situations to the desired level. That said, our biggest achievement has been the transition from uncertainty to stability. In the early days, there were speculations about whether the government would remain in power, or there would be a counter-revolution. There were conspiracies within the country, along with geopolitical pressures. There was an international campaign against us, and tensions surrounding minority communities in the country were deliberately flared. Now, those tensions have largely subsided. I believe this is significant progress. TDS: As for the law-and-order situation, incidents like muggings are occurring daily, even in broad daylight, which is concerning. Nahid: Yes, that's true -- some challenges still exist. Incidents of mugging and criminal activities are occurring in some areas. We're trying to restore the police's morale to its previous state. The police force is currently undergoing a transformation including new training and restructuring. However, such comprehensive changes take time. For example, many members of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police have been transferred outside Dhaka, and new officers have been brought to the capital. This transition period has created temporary challenges, as officers need time to adjust to their new environments. Initially, there was criticism when the police were perceived as inactive (following the fall of the AL government). Then when they took decisive actions, there was criticism again. Such contradictions make it difficult for them to stabilise. That said, we are committed to ensuring that the police regain full operational capacity. TDS: Why was the police uniform changed? Do you think it'll lead to any qualitative improvement in the force? Nahid: We don't expect a change in the uniform will solve everything, but it carries symbolic and psychological significance. A few days ago, I visited the graves of some martyrs. Relatives of one of the martyrs were infuriated upon seeing uniformed police officers who were accompanying me, even though they had no involvement in the deaths. The reactions might have been different if the officers were in plainclothes, as the primary identity of a force is represented through its uniform. This aspect is being taken into consideration. On one hand, we expect police to protect human rights, while on the other, they're responsible for controlling riots. The government is working to improve police effectiveness through advanced training. TDS: Various shrines have been attacked, while a girls' football match was disrupted. What're the reasons? Nahid: These incidents are deeply concerning and unacceptable, and may have occurred due to gaps in law-and-order situation. We acknowledge that such events are embarrassing for the government. We're taking these incidents seriously and trying to take appropriate action, while also considering compensation to the affected shrines. TDS: The students and youth say the election should be held after reforms. On the other hand, the chief adviser has announced an election timeline. Is there a conflicting position between these two issues? Nahid: From the beginning, we've maintained that elections and reforms are not contradictory. In fact, while elections are crucial for democracy, but reforms are equally necessary to ensure fair polls. Over the past 15 years, elections haven't been conducted properly. The people have lost much of their faith in the electoral institutions. During the (July-August) movement, we said we wanted to create a new arrangement to prevent the return of fascism. We want to ensure that no future government can manipulate the electoral system for party or personal gains. This is a long-term process, but we want to lay the foundation now. We want to take political (parties') commitment so that whoever comes to power will continue the reforms. TDS: Do you think the reforms can be completed within the timeframe set by the chief adviser? Nahid: If you notice, the first six reform commissions we formed are related to state structure and electoral reforms. Some of the commissions have already submitted their reports. We plan to discuss these issues with political parties this month. The parties were eager to know a specific timeframe. From that perspective, we believe the timeframe given by the chief adviser is consistent with the reform initiatives. TDS: BNP previously suggested that the election could be held on August 5, terming it a historic date. What is your response to this? Nahid: August 5 will also be a historic date in 2026. If this date is chosen as a milestone for the democratic journey, I don't see an issue. TDS: There are discussions regarding a political party by the students and youth, and the resignation of two advisers including yourself. Will you really be resigning? Nahid: As advisers, we're still focused on the government responsibilities. No decision has yet been made regarding our resignations. TDS: Since you were a key figure in the July uprising, many expect you to join a party. What's your personal view on this? Nahid: I haven't decided yet. My focus remains on where I can contribute most effectively. I need to carefully assess whether I can make a greater impact within the government or by working on the ground. When the time comes, I will make that decision based on what best serves the country. TDS: BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul has raised questions about the government's neutrality. Do you think this is related to the formation of the students' party? Nahid: The students didn't form a party immediately after the uprising in order to gain the trust of the political parties. If they had, many other would have shown interest in being involved and they still might. So, you can understand the perspective of the youth. The government prioritising the advice of political parties in making key decisions. When the issue of removing the president arose, we did the same. Therefore, BNP's allegations of bias aren't justified. I don't know if they're considering any alternative plan or other options by removing Dr Yunus. If they are, I don't believe it will serve them or the country well. TDS: Is there any crack developing in national unity? Nahid:The uprising brought together people from different political and ideological backgrounds. Naturally, there were differences, but that doesn't mean there is a lack of unity. During the movement, we took a united stance. So, differences will exist, but this does not mean it's a weakness. We don't expect everyone to have the same stance over every issue. However, the key question is how united we can remain on major national challenges. I believe that national unity is still intact. If it weren't and political parties didn't cooperate, it would've been more difficult to run the government. I hope this cooperation will continue in the future. Through our collective efforts, if we can maintain a consistent path towards reforms and ensure a responsible democratic transition, it'll be an achievement for all, especially those in the upcoming government. Their task will be easier. TDS: How much reform can realistically be accomplished? There isn't much time. Nahid: That's precisely why we weren't eager to announce an election timeline in haste. If even the minimal expectations of the people, shaped by the mass uprising and consequent bloodshed, are not met, they will lose faith in us and take to the streets. Sheikh Hasina's government was also an ""elected government"" in 2008, but it committed misdeeds. This suggests that an elected government doesn't necessarily guarantee the country's safety. We're aware of the recommendations made by ""Teen Joter Ruprekha (roughly translated to 'tri-alliance outline')"" in 1990, but those plans weren't implemented. This time, we aim to create a roadmap for the public through reforms in the state structure, which can continue no matter who comes to power next. TDS: Several journalists have been arrested and are in jail. Many were charged with murder, and some were laid off. Can these not be seen as a threat to freedom of press? Nahid: No one has been arrested for criticising the interim government. However, some individuals in the media are facing legal proceedings due to allegations of criminal activity that extend beyond journalism. Many of those who were closely involved with the previous regime and failed to uphold journalistic ethics, who were complicit with fascism, are accused of being involved in (the July) killings. However, I believe the role of journalists and the media over the past 15 years needs deeper discussion. It isn't possible to address these through the legal framework. There must also be some form of accountability for those who committed moral or social wrongs as collaborators of fascism.If the government takes such measures, it may be questioned. I think the initiative should come from within the media itself through independent reviews and professional standards bodies. TDS: While there may be allegations of financial wrongdoings against some journalists, but many are charged with murder. Isn't this putting pressure on other journalists? Nahid: We've ensured a process for review if any case isn't filed properly. We've also communicated with the law ministry regarding the accused in cases who have applied for a review. Some journalists are also facing corruption allegations, which are being investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission and other relevant government agencies. The government isn't pressuring the media, but there is undeniable public frustration. However, certain groups have portrayed this internationally as a crackdown on press freedom, which does not reflect the full picture. In the past, media outlets were forcibly shut down following changes in government. That hasn't happened since this government was formed, though there's resentment among the people over the role of some media outlets. I won't take names, but certain media outlets directly supported the fascist government during the July uprising. Was that ethical? To this day, they haven't acknowledged their role, nor have they explained their actions.They didn't say they wouldn't repeat such practices in the future. If the journalists who compromised ethical standards in the past takeresponsibility, acknowledge their misdeeds, and commit to not doing so in the future, this pressure perhaps will also lessen. TDS: The recently approved draft of the Cyber Protection Ordinance-2024 contains several repressive provisions, as highlighted by civil society groups such as Transparency International Bangladesh. What are your thoughts? Nahid: The law is being revised to ensure journalists and all sectors of society have freedom of speech and expression. I admit our government rushed the drafting process. The intention was to pass it quickly so that the victims of false cases filed under the Cyber Security Act could get some relief. Now, we've decided to cancel cases related to speech and writing offenses. TDS: Will the government take into account the concerns raised by stakeholders? Nahid: Absolutely. Further discussions will take place. We aim to create the best possible law with input from all stakeholders. I believe we can do that if stakeholder meetings are held properly. TDS: In your opinion, what will be the future of Awami League politics? Will it be able to participate in the next polls? Will it be banned? Nahid: It can't be definitively said at this moment. Whether Awami League should be banned or allowed to contest polle is something that requires national consensus. It'll also depend on the decisions from the courts and the Election Commission. However, as those who led the uprising, we believe Awami League has lost its moral and legal legitimacy to continue politics. TDS: But you have mentioned reconciliation… Nahid: Yes, but not under Awami League's banner. Those from the Sheikh family or individuals identified as corrupt or involved in mass killings have no right to continue politics. TDS: What about Awami League members who were not involved in corruption or violence? Nahid: There is no room for politics under the name or ideology of Awami League. Their ideology is fascist, which led to 15 years of oppression and mass killings. Those who realise their mistakes must abandon that ideology. Their political and civil rights remain intact -- they can join other parties or form a new one. TDS: If someone from the Awami League, who wants a clean image, wants to join the Anti-discrimination Students' Movement – would you accept them? Nahid: I am not currently involved with the platform, so I don't want to comment. TDS: You don't want Awami League to continue politics, but there's no provision for prosecuting a party in the amended ICT Act… Nahid: At that time, the decision was made based on consultations with national and international stakeholders. Legal experts and learned advisers of the advisory council gave their input. Our main focus is to ensure that the judicial process is not questioned. However, there're other ways to ban a party outside courts as well. TDS: Is such an initiative being taken? Nahid: For now, we're focusing on the judicial process. Once progress is made in that regard, decisions on related matters will become easier. TDS: Critics say if the prosecution of a party was included in the law, Jamaat-e-Islami would have to be prosecuted for its 1971 crimes as well… Nahid: That's not the case at all. After discussing with experts, all necessary actions to maintain international standards have been taken. TDS: Could you share something about the progress of the judicial process in ICT? Nahid: We hope that the judicial proceedings of the important cases will begin before August. TDS: Will the election be held after that? Nahid: It'll depend on the judicial timeline. However, our aim is for the public to see justice being served, and then move forward with a fair and credible election. TDS: If everything goes well, we'll be heading toward an election atmosphere in six months. What do you plan to do during this time? Nahid: Law and order, along with the economic condition, need further improvement. If the police aren't properly operational, holding an election will be difficult. Many people might've thought that an election will fix everything, but that's not the case. A good election requires a conducive atmosphere. We want to organise the most transparent and credible election in the country's history. The 1991 election is often considered the country's fairest election, but we aim to set an even higher standard. TDS: What challenges do you foresee? Nahid: Many Awami League goons are conspiring to destabilise the government. They're attempting various forms of sabotage with the support of foreign powers. Leaders and activists of different political parties in the country are getting involved in extortion and other criminal activities. We need to tackle these while moving towards the election. This isn't just for polls; it's essential for foreign investment and internal business environment. TDS: What does the interim government want to achieve within its first year? Nahid: The most significant one could be visible progress in the trial of the July massacre. People across the country are eagerly waiting for this. We want to ensure that martyr families and the injured are adequately compensated and rehabilitated. Law and order should reach a satisfactory level. Reform initiatives should lead to a political consensus so that we can present a framework for unity to the nation and ensure that future governments will continue the rest of the work."
Language Movement in Faridpur,"This year marks the 73rd anniversary of the 1952 Language Movement. Drawing on research based on various published books, this 21-part series tells the story of the historic struggle for our mother tongue. Like other parts of the country, the demand for Bangla as a state language was made also in Faridpur, where the Language Movement began in 1948. In February of that year, Muslim League leaders and many other members of the Pakistan Constituent Assembly opposed a proposal to use Bangla in state affairs. Immediately afterwards, like their peers in Dhaka, the students of Faridpur also erupted in protests centring Rajendra College and the schools. According to Ahmed Rafiq's book Bhasha Andolan: Teknaf Theke Tetulia, the protesters in Faridpur decided to successfully enforce a strike announced centrally from Dhaka for March 11, 1948 by the Rashtrabhasha Sangram Parishad. Rajendra College students, led by Syed Mahbub Ali, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Abdul Matin and others, started campaigning for the strike in the last week of February through processions and street rallies. A spontaneous strike was observed in Faridpur, Dr Abu Muhammad Delwar Hossain wrote in his book Bhasha Andolaner Ancholik Itihas. Police baton-charged the protesters, injuring Mahbub Ali, Mohiuddin Ahmed and several others when the demonstrators brought out a procession from Rajendra College and started marching around the city. The police detained 11 student leaders, but released them later due to the sympathetic role of Faridpur district's administrator Abdul Halim Chowdhury. After the government declared Urdu as the sole state language of Pakistan on January 27, 1952, a Rashtrabhasha Sangram Committee was formed in Faridpur in early February, with Imamuddin Ahmed as the president and Monowar Hossain as the general secretary. With the support of leftist leaders and activists, the movement spread all over Greater Faridpur. A Flag Day was observed in Faridpur on February 4. And it was decided that a strike would be enforced on February 21. According to the book Bhasha Andolone Faridpur by Rezaul Karim, the agitated students took to the streets when the news of killings of students in police firing in Dhaka on February 21 reached Faridpur that afternoon through telegram. Several student protesters in Faridpur were injured when the police clubbed them outside Kotwali Police Station. A full-day strike was observed in Faridpur on February 22. On that day, the students marched from Rajendra College to Chawkbazar Mosque in violation of section 144 of the CrPC, which restricts gatherings. The police attacked the procession and arrested several demonstrators. In protest, the students staged a sit-in outside Kotwali Police Station until the police released the arrested students at midnight. From February 23, Faridpur practically became a city of processions. All administrative activities came to a standstill as the movement spread to the rural areas. In protest against the killings in Dhaka, school students also joined the processions in Faridpur. The Daily Azad newspaper on February 27 reported that the students of Char Atra Azizia Junior High Madrasa in Faridpur enforced a full-scale general strike against the killings in Dhaka. They also flew the national flag at half-mast, brought out a procession and held a rally. [Translated and edited by Osham-ul-Sufian Talukder]"
Military extends emergency for  six months,"Myanmar's ruling military has extended a state of emergency for another six months, state media reported yesterday, a day ahead of the four-year anniversary of a coup that plunged the country into chaos after a decade of tentative democracy. Myanmar has been locked in a civil war triggered by the military's overthrow of the elected civilian government of Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi. The junta plans this year to hold an election, which critics have derided as a sham to keep the generals in power through proxies. ""There are still more tasks to be done to hold the general election successfully. Especially for a free and fair election, stability and peace is still needed,"" state-run Myanmar Digital News said on its Telegram channel in announcing the extension of emergency rule. The ruling military council headed by army chief Min Aung Hlaing unanimously approved the extension, the junta's information team said in a statement. Elections cannot be held under a state of emergency, so long-promised polls the junta has said will be held in 2025 will not take place until the second half of the year at the earliest. Min Aung Hlaing told the ruling council that ""peace and stability is still needed"" before the state of emergency can be lifted and polls held. Critics and Western governments have said that any elections held under the auspices of the junta will be neither free nor fair. The military seized power after making unsubstantiated allegations of fraud in 2020 elections which Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won in a landslide."
Graft allegations: Sri Lanka ‘revokes’ power purchase deal with Adani,"Sri Lanka has revoked a power purchase agreement with Indian conglomerate Adani Group following allegations of corruption, energy ministry sources in Colombo said yesterday. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake's administration opened probes into the company's local projects after billionaire founder Gautam Adani was charged with bribery in the United States late last year. The administration of his predecessor had agreed in May 2024 to buy electricity at US$0.0826 per kilowatt from an Adani wind power complex yet to be built in the island nation's northwest. But a top energy ministry official said Dissanayake's cabinet decided this month not to proceed with the deal. ""The government has revoked the power purchase agreement, but the project is not cancelled. A committee has been appointed to review the entire project,"" the source told AFP on condition of anonymity. Several activists had challenged the agreement, arguing that smaller renewable projects were selling electricity at two-thirds the price of Adani. The proposed construction of Adani's 484-megawatt wind power plant in the Mannar and Pooneryn coastal areas is facing a separate Supreme Court challenge over environmental concerns. An official document seen by AFP yesterday confirmed that Sri Lanka's cabinet this month decided to appoint a panel to ""re-evaluate"" the project's construction. It also confirmed the withdrawal from the power purchase agreement, which the current ruling party had strongly criticised while in opposition. Adani confirmed in a statement that Sri Lanka's cabinet had decided to ""re-evaluate the tariffs approved in May 2024"". It described Colombo's decision to revoke the power purchase agreement as a ""part of a standard review process, particularly with a new government, to ensure that the terms align with their current priorities and energy policies"". Shares in Adani Enterprises, the conglomerate's main listed unit, fell nearly three percent during yesterday trade in Mumbai. Dissanayake came to power in September promising to tackle corruption and bring back stolen Sri Lankan assets said to be stashed abroad. Indian industrialist Adani was charged in the United States on November 19, accused of paying bribes and hiding the payments from US investors, according to prosecutors in New York. Adani Group has dismissed the charges as ""baseless"". With a business empire spanning coal, airports, cement and media, Adani Group has been rocked by corporate fraud allegations in recent years. Adani was the first foreign investor to enter Sri Lanka in the wake of a 2022 financial crash that devastated the island's economy."
Investigators try to salvage aircraft,"Investigators yesterday pushed forward with efforts to retrieve the two aircraft involved in a crash in Washington that killed 67 people and raised questions about air safety in the US capital. Fresh from recovering the so-called black boxes from the American Airlines plane that crashed into the Potomac River after colliding with an Army Black Hawk helicopter on Wednesday, divers aim to ""salvage the aircraft"" and find additional components, Washington's fire department said. ""Overnight, boats will remain on scene for security and surface searches from local, state, and federal regional partners,"" it said. The National Transportation Safety Board is studying the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder from the CRJ700 airplane, which carried 60 passengers and four crew members, all of whom perished in the crash. The three members of the helicopter crew also died. The board said it will have preliminary report into disaster within 30 days. Authorities have not pinpointed a reason for the collision. The military said the maximum altitude for the route the helicopter was taking is 200 feet (61 meters) but it may have been flying higher. The collision occurred at an altitude of around 300 feet, according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24. Senator Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, questioned the safety of military and commercial flights separated by as little as 350 feet (107 m) vertically and horizontally."
"Arial Beel: High pumpkin yield, low profit for farmers","Despite a bumper harvest of pumpkins in the Arial Beel area of Munshiganj, farmers are struggling financially due to a steep decline in market prices. By the end of January, the water in Arial Beel had dried up, allowing farmers to harvest the pumpkins they had cultivated along the banks of the waterbodies in the area. Farmers typically grow two varieties of pumpkins: a larger, colourful local variety and a pest-resistant hybrid variety, which has gained popularity in recent years. While this year's harvest was abundant, market prices have fallen sharply, leaving farmers struggling to cover their production costs. ""Last year, I sold pumpkins for Tk 30-32 per kilogramme, but this year I'm getting only Tk 8-10 per kg. The situation is the same for all the 3-4 thousand farmers here. How can we survive like this?"" said Abul Kashem, a farmer from Gadighat in Shyamsiddhi union. The cost of production has also increased significantly. Fertiliser prices have risen by Tk 500-700 per bag compared to last year, and labour costs are adding to the financial strain, said farmers. Nurul Haque, another local farmer, said, ""It costs about Tk 15,000 to grow pumpkins, with additional costs for transporting the produce to the city. With the current market prices, we are barely covering our costs, let alone making any profit."" Contacted, Bipul Kumar Mohanta, deputy director of the DAE in Munshiganj, said farmers are currently selling pumpkins for Tk 15-20 per kg. He said no significant problems exist in the sector. Mohammad Samir Hossain Siam, agricultural marketing officer, said efforts are underway to find new markets with higher demand for pumpkins, which could help raise prices for local farmers."
Uprising injured block road in front of NITOR,"Injured protesters from last year's mass uprising blocked the road in front of the National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedic Rehabilitation (NITOR) in Dhaka yesterday night, demanding proper medical treatment, rehabilitation, and compensation. The demonstrators, many still recovering from serious injuries, also called for official recognition of their sacrifices. At least 50 injured, undergoing treatment at the NITOR and the National Institute of Ophthalmology and Hospital, blocked the Agargaon-Shishu Mela link road in front of NITOR around 9:30pm. The blockade to both lanes of the road caused severe disruption to traffic, with vehicles being rerouted, leading to heavy congestion in the surrounding areas. During a visit, this reporter saw some injured chanting slogans while lying on the road. Some were seen joining the protest with crutches, demanding justice and an end to discrimination. The blockade caused severe disruption to traffic, with vehicles being rerouted, leading to heavy congestion in the surrounding areas. The injured protesters stated that they played a role in bringing down the previous regime but have received no financial assistance. ""We do not want money, we only demand proper treatment and rehabilitation,"" said Rafiqul Islam, 30, who lost one of his eyes from a police rubber bullet in the capital's Mirpur-10 area on July 19. He said, ""It's been six months, but the government did not keep its promise. If needed, the government should send the victims abroad."" They further expressed frustration with the interim government, claiming it had failed to ensure their medical care. ""We have no faith in this administration or its advisers. That is why we are protesting,"" said Helal Hasan, a college student from Sirajganj. He was injured on the back in police firing on August 4. Golam Azam, officer-in-charge of the Sher-e-Bangla Nagar Police station, told The Daily Star, ""The injured of the anti-discrimination movement blocked the road peacefully. We are keeping an eye to maintain the law and order."" The blockade continued till the report was filed around 1:00am."
Remnants of fascist regime still present,"Although Sheikh Hasina's autocratic rule has ended, her regime's remnants are still present in the country, BNP Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman said yesterday. In a virtual address to the council of the party's Brahmanbaria district unit, he emphasised the need for all citizens to stay united in the face of any kind of challenge. He said that the ""autocratic Hasina"" government ruled the country for a long time, which may have eroded public trust in political parties. It is now the responsibility of BNP leaders and activists to rebuild confidence among the people. The only option for democratic forces is now to stay united to move the country forward and rebuild it with peace as the cohorts of the fallen fascists are trying to raise their ugly heads again, he added. ""The autocrats against whom we waged the movement are now on the run. Although the head of the autocratic regime fled, many of its remnants are still present in Bangladesh,"" he said. Although councils are supposed to be held every two years, the council at the field of Sohagpur Abbasuddin Khan Model College took place after nearly 12 years as part of the party's efforts to overhaul its grassroots. The party's acting chairman said that the conspirators continued their efforts to destabilise the country in various ways, including through agitations under the guise of placing various demands. ""We can't allow them to achieve their goal. If we want to protect ourselves, our families, the people of the country, and overall Bangladesh, we all must remain united at any cost. ""So, we take the first vow at this council that all BNP leaders and workers will remain united under any circumstances. Our second pledge is that, with the people, we'll build the country by maintaining unity,"" he said. The BNP leader said there could be differences of opinion among democratic parties and organisations on various political issues, including the future function of parliament, its tenure, the tenure of governments -- both interim and elected -- and the limit for a person's tenure as prime minister. ""We can resolve these issues through discussions. But if we engage in excessive debates on these matters, we will fall behind in rebuilding the country,"" he said. Tarique said the country and its people would suffer if the rebuilding activities of Bangladesh were hindered. ""We'll sit together and engage in discussions. If we can't resolve it in one sitting, we'll continue to meet and find solutions through dialogue."" He said the people of Bangladesh have not had the right to vote in the last 15 years, as the Awami League government took it away at gunpoint in the name of dummy, voter-less, and rigged elections. The BNP leader also accused the Hasina regime of destroying all institutions and plundering significant amounts of money in the name of development, as it had no accountability to the people. He said the government's accountability is ensured when the people can elect their representatives through their votes. At another programme, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said that Hasina continued to conspire against the country from Delhi. ""What kind of person is she (Hasina)? She has no remorse. She has killed so many people…,"" he said. He added that while the country has been freed from Hasina's rule, democracy has not yet been restored. Urging the interim government to remain neutral, Fakhrul said, ""Dr Yunus' government must ensure the election is held so that the people can reclaim their rights. The election must be conducted under a neutral administration."" [Our Brahmanbaria Correspondent contributed to this report]"
Justice for mass killing first even if it delays polls,"Justice for themass killingsduring the uprising must be ensured, even if it delays the elections, said Jamaat-e-Islami Ameer Shafiqur Rahman yesterday. ""Justice must be served to those who killed people in the past and during the student-led movement in this country. If elections have to be delayed for that, so be it,"" he said at a meeting of Sunamganj district Jamaat at Government Jubilee High School ground in Sunamganj. The Jamaat chief also slammed the political environment prevailing in the country. ""Real change is not possible through those who engage themselves in politics of deceit,"" he said, alleging that leaders of some political parties put party before the nation. ""Even they put individuals ahead of the party,"" he added. Taking a dig at the ousted Awami League, he said those who threatened to banish them have now fled the country. ""They used to send us abroad without passports, visas, or tickets; but now they are fleeing without those,"" he said. He also took a swipe at former Supreme Court judge Justice Shamsuddin Chowdhury Manik, saying, ""Have you seen a Supreme Court judge sleeping on a banana leaf? That was his fate due to his misuse of power while in office."" On education, he pledged that if Jamaat comes to power, it will prioritise education and establish a modern, job-oriented system. ""Our brightest minds leave the country for higher education and never return, whereas, in the past, the Mughals, British, and Portuguese came here seeking fortune. Now, the situation has reversed,"" he said. Highlighting the integrity of his party's activists, he said his party activists are not involved in any extortion or litigation trade. ""Criticise us as much as possible. It will only make us work harder. If we fail to deliver, you have every right to abandon us,"" he said. Shafiq said if Jamaat comes to power, Sunamganj will witness rapid development. ""If not, we will fight alongside the people for their rights and development,"" he said. Sunamganj district Jamaat Ameer Maulana Tofayel Ahmad, Jamaat's Assistant Secretary General Advocate Ahsanul Mahboob Zubair were present at the meeting among others."
Jubo dal leader’s death in custody: Who will I call baba now?,"After Touhidul Islam's body was brought back from Cumilla Medical College Hospital yesterday morning, his neighbours gathered at his house in Italla village to see him for the last time. His wife, four daughters, and relatives were found to be inconsolable. ""Who will I call baba now? He was such a good man. My good Baba...they tortured him and killed him. We, four sisters, are orphans now. I want justice for my father's murder,"" Tasfia Akhter, 14, Touhidul's eldest, said with a choked voice. Jubo Dal leader Touhidul Islam, 42, was allegedly tortured to death after being taken from his Cumilla residence in the early hours of Friday by members of the joint forces. The ambulance carrying Touhidul's body was later parked in front of the Cumilla Press Club, where hundreds of locals formed a human chain. They demanded justice, claiming that Touhidul was abducted and brutally murdered. Addressed the media, Touhidul's wife, Yesmin Nahar, said, ""In the early hours of Friday, four men arrived at our house and identified themselves as members of the joint forces. As soon as I let them in, they detained Touhidul and took away our phones. They said they were looking for illegal firearms and ransacked the house but found nothing. Then they left with my husband on a pickup truck without explaining why he was being taken. They said they wouldn't hurt him ""In the morning, they came back to our village. They were looking for a local named Kawser. Touhidul was with them at the time. He looked badly hurt."" Yesmin said Touhidul was not involved in any criminal activities. ""We want justice. We want those involved in his killing to be punished."" Lutfur Rahman, a neighbour, who was detained alongside Touhidul, said, ""They broke into my house and picked me up too. We were taken to the local army camp. There they tied Touhidul to a tree and tortured him all night. The individuals involved were wearing masks."" Touhidul's niece, Mahbuba Uddin, a teacher at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Science and Technology University, said, ""We spoke with army officials. An army officer from Cumilla Cantonment, Lieutenant Colonel Mahmudul Hasan, assured us that the army would take action against those responsible."" Touhidul was buried at his family graveyard after his funeral around 2:30pm. He was the convener of Jubo Dal's Panchthubi union unit. Touhidul used to work at a shipping company in Chattogram. He returned home on January 26 after his father's death. The family was supposed to hold a qulkhani on Friday. However, on Friday, his family members found Touhidul dead at Cumilla Medical College Hospital. Speaking to this newspaper on Friday, Mohinul Islam, officer-in-charge of Kotwali Police Station, said, ""The joint forces informed us around 11:00am that an injured man was found in Jhakunipara on the banks of the Gumti River. Police took Touhidul to Cumilla Medical College Hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead."" His body bore marks of trauma and injuries, according to an inquest report prepared by the Kotwali Police Station. However, Touhidul's family has yet to file a case. "
Swechchhasebak Dal leader killed as two BNP groups clash,"A Swechchhasebak Dal leader was killed during a clash between two groups of BNP men in Cumilla's Nangalkot upazila yesterday. The deceased was identified as Md Selim Bhuiyan, 45, convener of Hesakhal union unit of Swechchhasebak Dal, said police. Locals said there was a longstanding political rivalry between Gafur Bhuiyan, former BNP lawmaker, and Mobashwer Alam Bhuiyan, former president of the upazila BNP.

Nangalkot Police Station's Officer-in-Charge AK Fazlul Haque said their preliminary probe suggests that Selim was killed during a clash between two groups of BNP men. Gafur could not be reached for comments despite repeated attempts. Contacted, Alam said he knew nothing about the clash."
Leave government before forming party,"BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir has said the people of Bangladesh will not accept if the students -- who steered the Anti-Discrimination Movement -- form a political party by remaining in the interim government. Speaking at a programme on Saturday, he also called upon the student leaders to refrain from making unnecessary remarks that may lead to political confrontation. ""If students form a new political party, we don't have any objection. In fact, we'll be delighted and we'll welcome them,"" Fakhrul said while speaking at a clothes distribution programme for the destitute at a playground in Uttara's 13-No sector, organised by the Dhaka North City unit of BNP. He said the students can form a political party as part of their efforts to reach the people with their new thoughts and ideas. ""But if they form a party while in government, the people of this country will not accept it,"" the BNP leader observed. Fakhrul further expressed his commitment to cooperate with the students if they form the party through an accepted process. ""We'll work shoulder to shoulder with you (students) to ensure a fair election. At the same time, I would like to request you not to bring any unnecessarily confrontational rhetoric into politics. We hope for that,"" he said. The BNP leader said efforts are being made to destroy the unity among democratic forces by the associates of the Awami fascists. ""We must remain alert to avoid it."" Fakhrul also warned that the ghosts of the Awami League are trying to infiltrate different political parties. ""Don't let them do it. I urge our leaders and workers to ensure that no ghosts of the Awami League intrude into our party."" The BNP leader said the nation was freed from the autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina through the mass uprising. ""But our ultimate goal – the restoration of democracy -- has not yet been achieved."" He called upon the interim government to arrange the national election after completing the necessary reforms as early as possible. Fakhrul said their party leaders and workers fought and struggled for 15 years for the restoration of democracy through a credible election. ""Many of our leaders and workers died over the last 15 years. In the July movement, 426 of our leaders and activists were killed. What we ask from you (the interim government) is to remain neutral. You must remain completely impartial,"" he said. He reiterated that the next election must be held under a neutral government. ""We want the interim government to ensure the election is held in a completely neutral manner,"" Fakhrul said."

No intel on top criminals' whereabouts: DB,"Weeks after vowing to arrest top criminals, the Detective Branch today said although they are conducting drives to arrest them, they do not have any specific information on their whereabouts. DMP Additional Commissioner Rezaul Karim Mallick, also the DB chief, said this replying to a reporter's query today at a briefing at the DMP media centre. Allegations of murder, attempt to murder, and extortion involving top-listed criminals following their release from jail after August 5, were reported in different police stations in the capital, he said. The listed criminals include Imam Ul Hasan, alias ""Pichchi Helal"", and Sanjidul Islam Emon. The DB chief, however, assured that regular raids are being conducted to track and arrest those involved in illegal activities. ""We have already arrested several people of Picchi Helal and Emon gangs,"" he said. Today's briefing covered the recent arrest of one suspected mugger connected to the killing of a private car driver, and four suspected muggers centring the wrist-slitting incident of a youth in Adabar's Balur Math area. It also addressed the arrest of six in connection with the gold snatching case in front of the Kotwali court building. Additionally, the briefing mentioned the arrest of five individuals involved in the killing of Dania College student Minhaj in Jatrabari. ""The muggers are disrupting law and order. Special teams, including all units of DB, are working to arrest muggers,"" said the DB chief. Earlier on January 14, during a previous press briefing, the DB chief had vowed that no criminal, regardless of their status, would be spared. ""Whether it's Pichchi Helal, Emon, or any other top criminal, no one will be given leniency. They will be brought under the law,"" he said."
Need state reforms before polls: IAB secretary general,"Reforms must come before elections as the public no longer believes in promises of reform once a party comes to power, said Islami Andolon Bangladesh Secretary General Hafiz Maulana Yunus Ahmad today. He criticised past governments for failing to prioritise reforms despite being in power and emphasised that true welfare for the people can only be achieved through restructuring of the state before electoral processes. He was speaking as chief guest at the biennial conference of IAB's Bagerhat district branch at Swadhinata Udyan this afternoon. ""We have eliminated fascism through an unprecedented alliance, but now we see that this unity has split over the issues of reform and elections. As a result, we must engage in discussions once again,"" he said. ""One group has seized the positions vacated by the previous fascist rulers, which is raising concerns among the conscious citizens,"" he added. ""A major party is now speaking in the language of the Awami League, even mistreating Islamic scholars in various religious gatherings. If anyone behaves in a fascist manner, their fate will be the same as on August 5,"" he warned. The conference, presided over by Maulana Mahfuzur Rahman, president of Bagerhat district IAB, was attended by Maulana Lokman Hossain Jafri, central office secretary, as the special guest. At the end of the conference, a new six-member committee for the 2025-26 session was announced for the Bagerhat district branch."
Two of a family die as bus hits easy bike in Bagerhat,"Two people were killed and three others injured when a Dhaka-bound bus collided with an easy bike in Bagerhat's Morelganj. According to eyewitnesses, the Dhaka-bound GMS bus from Sharankhola crashed head-on into the easy bike in front of the Morelganj Fire Service and Civil Defence Station on the Signboard-Bogi regional highway this afternoon.

However, the bus staff are on the run. The process of legal action is underway."" The accident has once again raised concerns over reckless driving on regional highways, highlighting the urgent need for stricter traffic enforcement and improved road safety measures."
Indian troops kill 8 Maoists,"Indian commandos shot dead at least eight Maoist rebels in the dense jungles of central India yesterday, as security forces ramp up efforts to crush the long-running conflict. More than 10,000 people have been killed in the decades-long insurgency waged by the rebels, who say they are fighting for the rights of marginalised Indigenous people. The gunfight broke out early on Saturday in the forested areas of Bijapur district in the state of Chhattisgarh, considered the heartland of the insurgency. ""After a fierce gun battle, bodies of eight Maoists were recovered today from the jungles of Bijapur district,"" top police officer Sundarraj P. told AFP. Weapons recovered from the rebels included a grenade launcher and rifles, he said, adding that a search was still underway. A crackdown by security forces has killed some 287 rebels in the past year, an overwhelming majority in Chhattisgarh, according to government data. Amit Shah, India's home minister, said last year the government expected to crush the rebellion by 2026. The Maoists demand land, jobs and a share of the region's immense natural resources for local residents."
India conducts 3 trials of Very Short-Range Air Defence System,"India has successfully conducted three successive flight-trials of Very Short-Range Air Defence System (VSHORADS) from Chandipur off the coast of the Bay of Bengal in eastern state of Odisha, the defence ministry announced today. VSHORADS is a manually-portable air defence missile system designed and developed indigenously which has the capability to meet the needs of army, navy and air force, it said in a statement. During all the three flight-tests carried out by Defence Research and Development Organisation against high-speed targets flying at low altitude, the missiles intercepted and completely destroyed the targets having reduced thermal signature mimicking low-flying drones at different flying conditions. The flight-tests were carried out in final deployment configuration where in two field operators carried out weapon readiness, target acquisition and missile firing, according to the statement. The flight data captured by various range instruments like Telemetry, Electro-Optical Tracking System and Radar deployed by Integrated Test Range, Chandipur, confirmed the pin-point accuracy and established the capability of VSHORADS missile system in neutralising drones along with other classes of aerial threats, said the statement."
India's financial aid to Bangladesh remains unchanged,"India's financial assistance to Bangladesh, as proposed in the annual budget for financial year 2025-26 presented in parliament today, remains unchanged at last year's level of Rs 120 crore ($13.84 million). The latest Indian budget enhanced the assistance by 28.5 percent to the Maldives to Rs 600 crore from Rs 400 crore in the previous budget. The 2025-26 budgetary assistance to Bhutan has been pegged at Rs 2,150 crore, a decrease from Rs 2,543.28 crore in the last budget. The new budget provides for Rs 100 crore for Afghanistan with whom India's relations have of late seen an upward trajectory. India's assistance to its two other South Asian neighbours Nepal and Sri Lanka in the latest budget has been retained at last year's levels of Rs 700 crore and Rs 300 crore respectively. The budget for 2025-26 provides assistance of Rs 350 crore to Myanmar. Meanwhile, a major chunk of the budget's total allocation of Rs 2,33,211 crore for the Home Ministry has gone to the central armed police forces (CAPFs) that are responsible for internal security, guarding borders and securing vital installations. This is an increase from the revised estimate of Rs 1,05,647.19 crore in 2024-25 and will go towards better infrastructure, sophisticated weapons and training. The budgetary allocation for border infrastructure saw a sharp 87% rise — from Rs 2,794.57 crore to Rs 5,237.93 crore. This will be spent on the check posts along the international border and setting up surveillance infrastructure."
India's defence budget up by 9%,"India today hiked its defence budget for 2025-26 financial year by 9.5 percent over last fiscal in order to further boost the military's firepower through procurement of new aircraft, warships and other military hardware. The budget presented in parliament by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, allocated Rs 6,81,210 crore (approx $79 billion) in a marginal increase over the current fiscal's allocation of Rs 6.22 lakh crore ($74.3 billion). Out of the total budgetary outlay for 2025-26, a total of Rs 1,92,387 crore (approx $22.19 billion) has been allocated for capital expenditure that will largely take care of the new weapon systems. The Defence Ministry received the highest allocation in today's budget a month after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh declared 2025 as the ""year of reforms"" in the sector aimed at mordernising the armed forces. India has since last year intensified India's focus on self reliance in the defence sector. In 2024, significant strides were made towards achieving self-reliance, with the Ministry of Defence recording its highest-ever indigenous defence production value of Rs 1.26 lakh crore ($14.53 billion) and defence exports reaching Rs 21,083 crore ($2.43 billion). Some major weapons acquisitions planned by India next year like long- endurance remotely-piloted aircraft of high and medium altitude, stage payment of deck-based aircraft and next-generation submarines/ships/platforms will be funded out of this allocation. According to the Indian defence ministry, ""In the current geopolitical scenario where the world is witnessing a changing paradigm of modern warfare, Indian armed forces need to be equipped with state-of-the-art weapons and have to be transformed into a technologically-advanced combat-ready force."" The government said the capital investment in defence manufacturing sector has a cascading and multiplier effect in the National Economy which will boost the GDP and provide greater job opportunities to the youth of this country."
Indian soldiers kill two in J&K near Pak border,"Indian soldiers killed two fighters in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) along the heavily militarised frontier with Pakistan as they attempted to cross into the Indian-administered part of the disputed territory, the army said yesterday. Muslim-majority Kashmir has been divided between nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan since their independence in 1947, with both claiming the territory in full. An ""intense and heavy firefight"" was triggered Thursday night between soldiers and ""infiltrating terrorists"" near the de facto border known as the Line of Control (LoC), the Indian army's White Knight Corps said in a statement on social media. The overnight fighting led ""to the neutralisation of two terrorists"", the statement said, referring to the suspected rebels. Weapons and ""war-like stores"" were recovered from the site, the army said, but it was not clear if the bodies of slain fighters were also retrieved. The incident could not be independently verified. India has a permanent deployment of more than half a million soldiers in the territory, and rebel groups have fought for decades demanding independence for Kashmir or its merger with Pakistan."
Sri Lanka records highest deflation in 65 years,"Sri Lanka's consumer prices fell by 4.0 percent in January, the highest deflation rate since July 1960, official data showed yesterday, as the South Asian nation emerges from its worst economic meltdown. January was the fifth consecutive month of deflation, according to the Colombo Consumer Price Index. Inflation hit a record 69.8 percent in September 2022 at the height of the country's economic crisis, which saw months of widespread consumer goods shortages. Officials said sharp reductions in electricity and fuel costs contributed to the sharp fall in prices in January, but the central bank forecasts annual inflation in 2025 to be around 5.0 percent. Sri Lanka secured a $2.9 billion bailout loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after the 2022 crash. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, elected last year, has vowed to maintain the IMF bailout programme negotiated by his predecessor that includes higher taxes and cuts to state spending."
30 killed in India’s Kumbh festival stampede,"Dozens of people were killed in a pre-dawn stampede at the Maha Kumbh Mela in northern India yesterday, police sources and a Reuters witness said, as tens of millions gathered to take a dip in sacred river waters on the most auspicious day of a six-week Hindu festival. State authorities said at least 30 people were killed and 60 were injured in the pre-dawn stampede. Three police sources and a Reuters witness put the toll at nearly 40. Reuters counted 39 bodies inside the morgue of the local hospital. One of the three police sources and a fourth officer said all 39 were stampede victims. All three police sources said nearly 40 bodies had been brought to the morgue. Bodies were still being brought to the Moti Lal Nehru Medical College hospital morgue more than 12 hours after the tragedy at the world's biggest gathering of humanity. ""More bodies are coming in. We have nearly 40 bodies here. We are transferring them out as well and handing over to families one by one,"" one of the sources said. Senior police officer Vaibhav Krishna told reporters that 90 people were taken to the hospital after the stampede, of whom 30 died and the rest were being treated. Opposition parties blamed the stampede on what they called the government's ""mismanagement"" and ""VIP culture"". ""VIP culture should be curbed and the government should make better arrangements to meet the needs of common devotees,"" Rahul Gandhi, leader of main opposition Congress party, said on X, referring to politicians and celebrities being treated differently. Distraught relatives queued up to identify those killed by the stampede, which occurred when crowds surged towards the confluence of three rivers, where immersion is considered particularly sacred. Some witnesses spoke of a huge push that caused devotees to fall on each other, while others said closure of routes to the water brought the dense crowd to a standstill and caused people to collapse due to suffocation. An official at Prayagraj's SRN Hospital, where some of the injured were taken, said those who died had either suffered heart attacks or had comorbidities like diabetes. ""People came in with fractures, broken bones...Some collapsed on the spot and were brought dead,"" said the official, who did not want to be named. Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered condolences to ""devotees who have lost their loved ones"", without specifying the number of dead."
"30 killed, 60 hurt in festival stampede in India","At least 30 people were killed and 60 injured in a pre-dawn stampede at the Maha Kumbh Mela, in Prayagraj, formerly Allahabad, in India's Uttar Pradesh state, a senior official confirmed. The stampede occurred at the confluence of the Ganges, Jamuna, and the mythical Saraswati rivers as crores of devotees jostled for space to take a holy dip on the occasion of Mauni Amavasya, considered one of the most auspicious days in Hindu tradition. Deputy Inspector General of Uttar Pradesh Police Vaibhav Krishna said at a press conference in Prayagraj this evening that 30 people lost their lives, and 60 others sustained injuries in the tragic incident."
15 dead in India stampede at Hindu mega-festival,"A pre-dawn stampede at the world's largest religious gathering killed at least 15 people in India Wednesday, with many more injured after a surging crowd spilled out of a police cordon and trampled bystanders. Deadly crowd incidents are frequent occurrence at Indian religious festivals, including the Kumbh Mela, which attracts tens of millions of devotees every 12 years to the northern city of Prayagraj. As pilgrims rushed to participate in a sacred day of ritual bathing, people sleeping and sitting on the ground near the rivers told AFP they were trampled by huge swells of devotees coming towards them in the darkness. ""I was sitting near a barricade, and during the pushing and shoving, the entire crowd fell on top of me, trampling me as it moved forward,"" Pilgrim Renu Devi, 48, told AFP. ""When the crowd surged, elderly people and women were crushed, and no one came forward to help."" Rescue teams carrying victims from the accident site weaved through piles of clothes, shoes and other discarded belongings. Police were seen carrying stretchers bearing the bodies of victims draped with thick blankets. ""At least 15 people"" were killed with dozens more injured, a doctor at a hospital tending to survivors told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to talk to media. Authorities have yet to officially confirm the number of dead in the stampede, which took place around 1:00 am (1930 GMT Tuesday). Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the accident was ""extremely sad"" and offered his ""deepest condolences"" to relatives of those killed. ""I wish for the speedy recovery of all injured,"" he added. Dozens of relatives were anxiously waiting for news outside a large tent serving as a purpose-built hospital for the festival around one kilometre (0.6 miles) from the disaster site.

Pak outlaws disinfo with 3yr jail term,"Pakistan criminalised online disinformation yesterday, passing legislation that enshrines punishments of up to three years in prison, a decision journalists say is designed to crack down on dissent. The law targets anyone who ""intentionally disseminates"" information online that they have ""reason to believe to be false or fake and likely to cause or create a sense of fear, panic or disorder or unrest"". The law was rushed through the National Assembly with little warning last week before being approved by the Senate yesterday as journalists walked out of the gallery in protest. Senior journalist Asif Bashir Chaudhry, a member of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, told AFP the government had assured reporters they would be consulted but said they were ""betrayed and backstabbed"". ""We genuinely wanted a law against misinformation, but if it's not being done through open discussion but rather through fear and coercion, we will challenge it on every available platform,"" Chaudhry said. ""Even under dictatorships, legislation was not forcefully rammed through parliament the way this government is doing now."" The bill will now be passed to the president to be rubber-stamped. Facebook, TikTok and Whatsapp are among the most popular social media platforms in Pakistan, where low digital literacy fuels the spread of false information, conspiracy theories and deepfakes. Analysts say the government is struggling with legitimacy after an election last February plagued by rigging allegations and with Pakistan's most popular politician, former prime minister Imran Khan, in jail on a slew of corruption charges his party says are politically motivated. Khan's supporters and senior leaders have also faced a severe crackdown, with thousands rounded up and Khan's name censored from television. Senator Syed Shibli Faraz, a member of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, called the new law ""highly undemocratic"" and said it would ""fuel the political victimisation"" of their supporters. There has been a proliferation of ""disinformation"" laws, including criminal legislation, worldwide in the past decade enabling governments to control speech online and police ""fake news"", according to human rights organisation Article 19. Such laws can impede journalism, according to the group, which promotes freedom of expression and information globally."
Pakistan army foils militant attempt to take post,"Militants in an explosive-laden vehicle were thwarted in their attempt to overrun a Pakistani security post near the border with Afghanistan, the army said yesterday. The five attackers, including two suicide bombers, were killed when the post came under attack in Qila Abdullah district of Balochistan, the military said in a statement. ""The attempt to enter the post was effectively thwarted by our own troops,"" it said, adding that the Pakistani troops forced the militants to ram the explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. Two soldiers were killed, it said."
Trump pushes India's Modi on 'fair' trade,"US President Donald Trump pressed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for ""fair"" trading ties in a call Monday, the White House said, as Trump continues to push his hardline trade agenda with world leaders. Trump however also discussed plans for a visit to the White House by Modi, the Hindu nationalist leader with whom he had close ties in his first term as president, a readout of the call said. The White House said the call was ""productive"" and that the two leaders ""discussed expanding and deepening cooperation."" During the call Trump ""emphasized the importance of India increasing its procurement of American-made security equipment and moving toward a fair bilateral trading relationship."" Trump and Modi also discussed strengthening the so-called ""Quad"" grouping with Australia and Japan, which is widely seen as a counterweight to China. India is due to host the bloc's leaders later this year. Modi earlier said on X that he was ""delighted to speak with my dear friend"" Trump. The Indian and US leaders -- whom critics both accuse of authoritarian tendencies -- enjoyed warm relations when Trump was in the White House from 2017 to 2021. Modi hosted Trump at a huge rally in his home state of Gujarat, while Trump returned the favor with a similar event in Houston, Texas. But their personal ties failed to bring a breakthrough on a long-sought US-India trade deal. Trump has taken an aggressive stance on trade in his first week in office as he seeks to redress what he says is an imbalance with other countries ""ripping off"" the United States. He has promised to slap tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, and over the weekend threatened tariffs against Colombia after it refused to take in deported migrants aboard several US military planes. Colombia eventually backed down."
"India, China agree to resume direct air services","India and China have agreed to resume direct air services between the two countries, New Delhi said in a statement yesterday after Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri visited Beijing and held talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Their meeting was the latest between the two Asian powers following an agreement in October seeking to ease tension on their disputed frontier. China and India should work in the same direction, explore more substantive measures and commit to mutual understanding, Wang Yi told Misri in Beijing. China and India should commit to ""mutual support and mutual achievement"" rather than ""suspicion"" and ""alienation,"" Wang said during the two officials' meeting, according to the Chinese foreign ministry's readout. Relations between China and India had been strained following a military clash on their border in 2020. Ties have improved over the past four months with several high-level meetings, including talks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Russia in October. In December, Wang and India's national security adviser, Ajit Doval, agreed to seek ways to manage their border issue and step up efforts to build trust, at their second meeting in less than five months. Paving the way for those talks was an agreement in October to disengage troops at two key face-off points on the countries' largely undemarcated western Himalayan frontier in Ladakh. Meanwhile, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump spoke in a phone call yesterday, Modi said in a post on X, the first conversation between the two leaders since Trump's inauguration last week."
‘We will rid Delhi of all illegals’,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's closest political ally has pledged to rid the capital of ""illegal' immigrants if his party wins looming elections, in a forceful appeal to his party's Hindu constituency. Interior minister Amit Shah said every unlawful migrant from neighbouring Bangladesh would be expelled from New Delhi ""within two years"" if his party succeeded in next month's provincial polls. ""The current state government is giving space to illegal Bangladeshis and Rohingyas,"" Shah told an audience of several thousand at Sunday's rally. ""Change the government and we will rid Delhi of all illegals."" India shares a porous border stretching thousands of kilometres with Muslim-majority Bangladesh, and illegal migration from its eastern neighbour has been a hot-button political issue for decades. There are no reliable estimates of the number of Bangladeshis living illegally in Delhi, a city to which millions have flocked in search of employment from elsewhere in India over recent decades."
Indian state implements common civil code,"An Indian state announced yesterday it had begun implementing a common civil code to replace religious laws, stoking fear among minority Muslims of a looming nationwide rollout by the Hindu-nationalist ruling party. Introduction of a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) to replace India's patchwork of laws on marriage, divorce and inheritance has been a longstanding goal of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The northern state of Uttarakhand, taking in much of the Indian Himalayas, yesterday became just the second Indian state to implement such a law. Goa is the only part of the country that already had a common civil code -- introduced when it was still a Portuguese colony."
"India shows military might, diversity","Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto looked on as guest of honour at India's annual military and cultural parade in New Delhi held to mark the country's 76th Republic Day yesterday. Republic Day marks the adoption of India's post-independence constitution in 1950 with the parade being held at a revamped colonial-era boulevard that also hosts important government buildings. ""May this occasion strengthen our efforts towards preserving the ideals of our Constitution and working towards a stronger and prosperous India,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said yesterday on social media platform X. The annual show is a colourful and tightly choreographed spectacle featuring missile systems, fighter jet fly pasts, motorbike stunts and floats representing different Indian states."
Hamas-Israel complete 4th hostage-prisoner swap,"Freed Palestinian inmates were greeted by a cheering crowd in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah yesterday, after Hamas released three Israeli hostages from the Gaza Strip in the fourth exchange under the group's ceasefire deal with Israel. Three other buses carrying freed Palestinians also arrived in the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis, with the inmates in grey prison uniforms met by hundreds of well-wishers. In Ramallah, the bus carrying the inmates struggled to make its way through the jubilant throng of supporters as it arrived from the Israeli-run Ofer Prison. Several of the freed inmates were hoisted onto the crowd's shoulders, including an elderly man who raised his crutches over his head in a triumphant pose. Earlier in Gaza, hostages Ofer Kalderon and Yarden Bibas were paraded on stage by Hamas fighters before being handed over to the Red Cross in the southern city of Khan Yunis. American-Israeli Keith Siegel was freed shortly thereafter in a similar ceremony at Gaza City's port in the north. Israel's military later confirmed that all three were back in Israel. Israeli campaign group the Hostages and Missing Families Forum hailed the release as ""a ray of light in the darkness"". After holding the hostages for more than 15 months, Hamas began releasing them on January 19 under the terms of the ceasefire deal with Israel. Groups in Gaza have so far handed over 18 hostages to the International Committee of the Red Cross in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, many of them women and minors. The Palestinian Prisoners' Club advocacy group had said Israel would free 183 prisoners yesterday. Hamas sources said a fifth hostage-prisoner exchange would take place next Saturday. After yesterday's hostage release, Gaza's key Rafah border crossing was reopened, with the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory saying 50 Palestinian patients had gone through the crossing to Egypt. The fragile ceasefire's 42-day first phase hinges on the release of a total of 33 hostages in exchange for around 1,900 people, mostly Palestinians, held in Israeli jails. Negotiations for a second phase of the deal are set to start on Monday, according to a timeline provided by an Israeli official. The second phase is expected to cover the release of the remaining captives and to include discussions on a more permanent end to the war."
56 killed as fighting grips greater Khartoum,"Artillery shelling and air strikes killed at least 56 people across greater Khartoum on Saturday, according to a medical source and Sudanese activists. Sudan's regular army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have been locked in a battle for power since April 2023 that has intensified this month as the army fights to take all of the capital Khartoum and its sister cities of Omdurman and Khartoum North. RSF shelling killed 54 people at a busy market in Omdurman on Saturday, overwhelming the city's Al-Nao Hospital, a medical source told AFP. ""The shells hit in the middle of the vegetable market, that's why the victims and the wounded are so many,"" one survivor told AFP. Across the Nile in Khartoum, two civilians were killed and dozens wounded in an air strike on an RSF-controlled area, the local Emergency Response Room (ERR) said. Although the RSF has used drones in attacks including on Saturday, the fighter jets of the regular armed forces maintain a monopoly on air strikes. The ERR is one of hundreds of volunteer committees across Sudan coordinating emergency care. In addition to killing tens of thousands of people, the war has uprooted more than 12 million and forced most health facilities out of service. A volunteer at Al-Nao Hospital told AFP it faced dire shortages of ""shrouds, blood donors and stretchers to transport the wounded"". The hospital is one of the last medical facilities operating in Omdurman and has been repeatedly attacked. After months of stalemate in greater Khartoum, the army retook several bases in Khartoum last month, including its pre-war headquarters, pushing the RSF increasingly into the city's outskirts. Witnesses said Saturday's bombardment of Omdurman came from the city's western outskirts, where the RSF remains in control. A resident of a southern neighbourhood reported rocket and artillery fire on the city's streets."
Philadelphia plane crash marks a second US aviation disaster,"A medical jet with six Mexican nationals onboard crashed into a busy Philadelphia neighborhood Friday, authorities said, marking another US aviation disaster after a passenger plane and a military helicopter collided midair in Washington earlier this week. Video footage appeared to show the twin-engine plane descending at a sharp angle towards a residential area, sparking a huge fireball upon impact and showering wreckage over homes and vehicles. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the aircraft was a Learjet 55 -- an American-French business jet -- that had taken off shortly before from Northeast Philadelphia Airport bound for Branson, Missouri. The crash happened just after 6:00 pm (2300 GMT). A young girl who had been in the United States for medical care, her mother, and members of the flight and medical crews accompanying her onboard were killed in the crash, the children's hospital that treated her told AFP. ""The patient had received care from Shriners Children's Philadelphia and was being transported back to her home country in Mexico on a contracted air ambulance when the crash happened,"" said Mel Bower, a spokesman for Shriners Children's. All six of those onboard were Mexican citizens, the country's foreign ministry said in a statement. ""The airline company... confirmed to the consulate that six people of Mexican nationality were traveling on the aircraft,"" the ministry wrote on X. The operator, Jet Rescue Air Ambulance, confirmed in a statement to US media that there were two passengers and four crew, adding, ""At this time, we cannot confirm any survivors."" Dozens of emergency workers were on the scene outside Roosevelt Mall, a strip mall in Northeast Philadelphia with retailers and food outlets. US President Donald Trump posted Friday on his Truth Social platform that he was ""sad"" to see ""more souls lost"" in the Philadelphia tragedy. He praised first responders, adding: ""God Bless you all."" Witnesses told local TV crews that they saw body parts in or near the wreckage, as Philadelphia City Council member Mike Driscoll said he feared residents or others on the ground may have been killed. ""It doesn't look good. And it's a sad situation here,"" he told CNN. The FAA said it was launching an investigation with the National Transportation Safety Board. - Washington tragedy - Both agencies are already probing the deadliest US air disaster in almost a quarter century, after a passenger jet operated by an American Airlines subsidiary collided with a Black Hawk helicopter on Wednesday. The airliner with 64 people onboard was landing at Reagan National Airport in Washington -- just miles from the White House -- when it collided with the US Army helicopter on a training mission. Divers were scouring Friday for the remaining bodies in the frigid Potomac River, after having pulled at least 41 from the water. Investigators on Friday found the helicopter's black box after having already retrieved the cockpit voice and flight data recorder from the Bombardier jet operated by an American Airlines subsidiary. Officials are confident data can be fully extracted from the recorders, said NTSB member Todd Inman, adding an investigation was still being carried out. However, the lack of clarity over the accident's cause did not deter Trump's politicized commentary. He appeared to place blame on the military helicopter in a post on the Truth Social platform, saying it was ""flying too high, by a lot."" This followed a news conference Thursday where the Republican pinned the blame for the crash on his Democratic predecessors Joe Biden and Barack Obama, claiming without evidence they had hired the wrong people due to non-discrimination initiatives known as DEI. Chesley Sullenberger, who famously landed a stricken passenger plane on New York's Hudson River in 2009, told network MSNBC he was ""disgusted"" but ""not surprised"" by Trump's rhetoric. Aviation experts homed in on whether the helicopter crew could see through military night-vision goggles -- and whether the control tower was understaffed. The collision was the first major crash in the United States since 2009, and the deadliest since an American Airlines jet crash in Belle Harbor, New York in 2001 that killed all 260 aboard. Among those on Wednesday's doomed airliner were several US skaters and coaches, and Russian couple Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, who won the 1994 world pairs title. Two Chinese citizens and a Filipino were also among the victims."
Russia slams Trump’s missile defence shield plan,"Russia yesterday condemned an executive order by US President Donald Trump to build a new missile defence shield, accusing the United States of trying to upset the global nuclear balance and pave the wave for military confrontation in space. Trump on Monday signed an order that ""mandated a process to develop an 'American Iron Dome,'"" a next-generation US missile defence shield against ballistic, hypersonic, cruise missile and other forms of aerial attack. The White House said the intention was to modernise an outdated system and address a ""catastrophic threat"" that had become more complex as US adversaries developed new delivery systems. But Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the plan was aimed at undermining the ability of both Russia and China to exercise nuclear deterrence. In the sharpest Russian criticism so far of a policy announced by Trump's new administration, she said that the planned US move would hinder the prospects for talks on nuclear arms control - something that both Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have said they favour. ""It (the plan) directly envisages a significant strengthening of the American nuclear arsenal and means for conducting combat operations in space, including the development and deployment of space-based interception systems,"" Zakharova told reporters at a news briefing in Moscow. ""We consider this as another confirmation of the US focus on turning space into an arena of armed confrontation... and the deployment of weapons there. ""The indicated US approaches will not contribute to reducing tensions or improving the situation in the strategic sphere, including creating a basis for a fruitful dialogue on strategic offensive arms,"" she said. The White House's Iron Dome statement did not refer to strengthening the US nuclear arsenal, but said: ""The Iron Dome will further the goals of peace through strength. By empowering the United States with a second-strike capability, the Iron Dome will deter adversaries from attacks on the homeland."" Trump and Putin have both said they would like to meet face-to-face to discuss a range of issues, including the Ukraine war."
"Trump says Canada, Mexico tariffs on Saturday may not include oil","US President Donald Trump on Thursday said he would soon decide whether to exclude Canadian and Mexican oil imports from the 25% tariffs that he has vowed to impose on Saturday on the countries' products. ""We may or may not. We're going to make that determination probably tonight,"" Trump said about whether he would impose tariffs on Canadian and Mexican oil. He added that this would partly depend on prices and on whether the two countries ""treat us properly."" Trump has set a Saturday deadline to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada to push the two largest US trading partners to take action to halt illegal migrants and shipments of fentanyl from crossing their borders into the US But Trump on Thursday said the North American duties would be imposed ""for a number of reasons"" and said the tariff level ""may or may not rise with time."" Trump also said he was still considering new tariffs on Chinese goods, citing its part in the fentanyl trade. He has threatened a 10% duty on all Chinese goods, after imposing punitive tariffs on some $370 billion worth of Chinese imports during his first term in office. ""With China I'm also thinking about something because they're sending fentanyl into our country and because of that they're causing us hundreds of thousands of deaths, so China is going to end up paying a tariff also for that and we're in the process of doing that,"" Trump told reporters. ""We'll make a determination on what it's going to be, but China has to stop sending fentanyl into our country and killing our people."" Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged in 2023 to work with then-president Joe Biden to curb fentanyl shipments into the US, but Beijing has called on Washington to take steps to curb demand for drugs. Mexico's economy ministry declined comment on Trump's latest remarks. The office of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was not immediately available for comment."
Investigators recover plane black boxes from Washington air collision,"Investigators on Thursday recovered the black boxes from a passenger plane whose mid-air collision with a military helicopter over Washington's Potomac river killed 67 people, as rescuers pulled victims' bodies from the freezing water. US President Donald Trump launched a political attack blaming diversity and inclusion policies championed by his Democratic predecessors for causing the incident. Trump's politicization of the tragedy came as the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said it had recovered the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder from the Bombardier jet operated by an American Airlines subsidiary that smashed into an Army Black Hawk helicopter late Wednesday. ""The recorders are at the NTSB labs for evaluation,"" the agency said in a statement to AFP. According to a New York Times report, staffing was thin in the control tower at Reagan National Airport, where the airliner was about to land when the collision occurred. One controller, rather than the usual two, was handling both plane and helicopter traffic, the Times quoted a preliminary Federal Aviation Administration report as saying. A fireball erupted in the night sky and both aircraft tumbled into the icy Potomac, leaving rescue crews with the grim, difficult task of searching for bodies in the dark and cold. Over 40 bodies had been recovered as of Thursday evening, according to US media reports. Trump politicizes crash Trump, who took office 10 days ago, turned a press conference on the disaster into a platform for his crusade against diversity, equity and inclusion or DEI -- a series of often decades-old measures meant to combat racism and sexism across the United States. Accusing his Democratic predecessors Joe Biden and Barack Obama of having kept good employees out of the aviation agency in pursuit of DEI, he claimed: ""They actually came out with a directive: 'too white.' And we want the people that are competent."" The passenger plane was carrying 64 people and the Black Hawk had three aboard. The collision -- the first major crash in the United States since 2009 when 49 people were killed near Buffalo, New York -- occurred as American Eagle Flight 5342 from Wichita, Kansas came in to land. Reagan National is a major airport located a short distance from downtown Washington, the White House and the Pentagon. The airspace is extremely busy, with civilian and military aircraft a constant presence. Trump opened his White House press conference by speaking of the nation's anguish. However, he then launched into an extended broadside against DEI, aiming directly at Biden's openly gay transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg. ""He's run it right into the ground with his diversity,"" Trump said. The message was hammered home as Trump's vice president, JD Vance, and new defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, took turns at the podium to repeat -- without evidence -- the hard-right theory that diversity measures keep capable Americans out of responsible jobs. Asked again by reporters whether he was blaming workplace diversity for the crash, Trump answered: ""It could have been."" Buttigieg responded on X, calling Trump ""despicable."" ""As families grieve, Trump should be leading, not lying,"" he said. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy posted that Trump's comments ""blaming the FAA's hiring of women and black people for the crash -- was disgusting."" ""He's in charge. This happened on his watch,"" Murphy said. Trump doubled down, however, later issuing an official memo directing the government to investigate ""deterioration in hiring standards"" under Biden and ""replacement"" of anyone unqualified. Skaters among victims Among those on the airliner were several US skaters and coaches, US Figure Skating said. Officials in Moscow also confirmed the presence of Russian couple Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, who won the 1994 world pairs title. Two Chinese citizens were also among the victims of the crash, state news agency Xinhua reported Friday in Beijing, citing the Chinese embassy. The force of the collision soon made it clear that survivors were unlikely. ""I just saw a fireball and it was gone,"" one air traffic controller was heard telling a colleague after communication with the helicopter was cut. Transport officials said both aircraft were on standard flight patterns on a clear night with good visibility. And Hegseth said the chopper had ""a fairly experienced crew that was doing a required annual night evaluation."""
Pro-Gaza Campaign: Trump admin to cancel US visas of student protesters,"US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday to ""combat antisemitism"" and pledged to deport non-citizen college students and others who took part in pro-Palestinian protests. A fact sheet on the order promises ""immediate action"" by the Justice Department to prosecute ""terroristic threats, arson, vandalism and violence against American Jews"" and marshal all federal resources to combat what it called ""the explosion of antisemitism on our campuses and streets"" since the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Palestinian group Hamas. ""To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you,"" Trump said in the fact sheet. ""I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before,"" the president said, echoing a 2024 campaign promise. Rights groups and legal scholars said the new measure would violate constitutional free speech rights and would likely draw legal challenges. Meanwhile, Trump said on Wednesday he will order the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security to prepare a migrant detention facility at Guantanamo Bay for as many as 30,000 migrants. The US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, already houses a migrant facility - separate from the high-security US prison for foreign terrorism suspects - that has been used on occasion for decades, including to hold Haitians and Cubans picked up at sea. Trump's border czar Tom Homan said later on Wednesday that the administration would expand the already existing facility and that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency would run it. ""Today I'm also signing an executive order to instruct the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security to begin preparing the 30,000 person migrant facility at Guantanamo Bay,"" Trump said at the White House."
"All 67 dead as US jet, chopper collide mid-air","US President Donald Trump confirmed the deaths of all those aboard an airliner and a military helicopter which collided mid-air over Washington's Potomac river yesterday. Trump launched an extraordinary political attack blaming diversity hires for the collision and mentioned pilot error on the helicopter in the nighttime crash. As Trump spoke in the White House, police divers searched for more bodies in the water. Wreckage of the Bombardier jet operated by an American Airlines subsidiary protruded from the river surface, surrounded by emergency vessels and diving teams. It had been carrying 64 people. The army Blackhawk helicopter, which had three soldiers aboard, was also in the river. ""We are now at a point where we are switching from a rescue operation to a recovery operation,"" Washington Fire Chief John Donnelly said. Twenty eight bodies had already been found. The collision -- the first major crash in the United States since 2009 when 49 people were killed near Buffalo, New York -- occurred late evening on Wednesday as the airliner came into land at Reagan National Airport after a routine flight from Wichita, Kansas. Reagan National is a major airport located a short distance from downtown Washington, the White House and the Pentagon. The airspace is extremely busy, with civilian and military aircraft a constant presence. Dramatic audio from air traffic controllers showed them repeatedly asking the helicopter if it had the passenger jet ""in sight,"" and then just before the crash telling it to ""pass behind"" the plane. Trump politicizes crash Trump opened his press conference by speaking of the nation's ""anguish"" and said that the investigation would take time. However, he then launched into an extended broadside against so-called diversity, equity and inclusion policies. Trump -- who began his presidency a week ago with an onslaught against decades-old measures aimed at preventing sexism and racism in the United States -- singled out Biden's openly gay transport secretary Pete Buttigieg. ""He's run it right into the ground with his diversity,"" Trump said. The message was hammered home as Trump's vice president, JD Vance, and new defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, took turns at the podium to repeat that diversity measures kept capable Americans out of responsible jobs. Asked again by reporters whether he was blaming workplace diversity for the crash, Trump answered: ""It could have been."" Buttigieg responded on X, calling Trump ""despicable."" ""As families grieve, Trump should be leading, not lying,"" he said. Skaters among victims Hundreds of rescuers were rapidly at the scene, but found themselves battling darkness and floating ice through the night. Some of the debris was located a mile downriver. Among those on the airliner were several US skaters and coaches, US Figure Skating said. Officials in Moscow also confirmed the presence of Russian couple Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, who won the 1994 world pairs title. The violence of the collision soon made it clear that survivors were unlikely. ""I just saw a fireball and it was gone,"" one air traffic controller was heard telling a colleague after communication with the helicopter was cut. What happened? Transport officials said both aircraft were on standard flight patterns on a clear night with good visibility. Hegseth said the Black Hawk chopper had ""a fairly experienced crew that was doing a required annual night evaluation."" ""Do I think this was preventable? Absolutely,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said. Trump, in addition to blaming racial and other kinds of diversity policies, offered extended remarks on the flight paths. The helicopter was ""going at an angle that was unbelievably bad,"" Trump said."
Russian drone barrage kills 4 in east Ukraine,"A Russian drone attack that targeted cities across Ukraine killed at least four people in a Soviet-era residential block in the eastern city of Sumy, the interior ministry said yesterday. Moscow has pummelled Ukrainian cities with dozens of drones or missiles almost daily since it invaded Ukraine in early 2022. Images distributed by emergency services showed a gaping hole ripped into the side of the building and rescue workers working with head lamps digging through debris for survivors. ""This is a terrible tragedy, a terrible Russian crime. It is very important that the world does not pause in putting pressure on Russia for this terror,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on social media. Ukraine's human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said four people were killed and nine others, including a child, were wounded in Sumy. The town lies just over the border from Russia in northeastern Ukraine and has been targeted regularly in Russian aerial attacks. Some 255,672 people lived there before the war. The Ukrainian air force said Moscow had attacked with 81 drones, including the Iranian-designed Shahed type unmanned aerial vehicles."
Israel military intercepts Hezbollah drone,"The Israeli military said it intercepted a surveillance drone launched by Lebanese militant group Hezbollah yesterday amid a fragile ceasefire. ""A short while ago, a Hezbollah surveillance UAV that was launched toward Israeli territory was intercepted by the Israeli Air Force,"" the military said in a statement. On Wednesday, five people were injured in an Israeli drone strike targeting the southern Lebanese town of Majdal Selm, the Lebanese health ministry said. On Tuesday, Israeli airstrikes injured 36 people in Nabatieh, a major town in south Lebanon, according to the health ministry. The Israeli military said it had struck Hezbollah vehicles that were transporting weapons on the edge of Nabatieh. The Israeli army also detained three people on Wednesday in southern border town of Maroun al-Ras, Lebanese state news agency NNA reported. Israel has carried out strikes in southern Lebanon although Hezbollah and Israel agreed on a ceasefire in late November. Lebanese Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem said on Monday that the group would not accept any justifications to extend the period for Israeli troops' withdrawal from southern Lebanon."
Ready for nuke talks if West is ‘serious’: Iran,"Iran is ready to discuss its nuclear programme if Western countries show they are ""serious"", the foreign ministry spokesman was quoted as saying in an interview published yesterday. ""We have said several times that we are ready for discussions, but only if the other side is serious about this,"" Esmaeil Baqaei told the government daily Iran. Tehran has signalled to the West several times recently indicating a willingness to reach an agreement over its nuclear programme. In an interview with Sky News posted to his official Telegram channel on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the new US administration should work to win back Tehran's trust if it wants a new round of nuclear talks. In yesterday's interview, Baqaei expressed hope that new US President Donald Trump would adopt a ""realistic approach"" towards Iran. During his first term that ended in 2021, Trump pursued a policy of ""maximum pressure"", withdrawing the United States from a landmark nuclear deal which imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief. Asked about the possibility of new talks, Baqaei was quoted yesterday as saying Iran's policy would depend on ""the actions of the other parties"". Tehran adhered to the deal until a year after Washington's withdrawal in 2018, but then began rolling back its commitments. Efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear pact have since faltered. Iran has repeatedly expressed willingness to revive the nuclear deal, and President Masoud Pezeshkian, who took office last July, has called for an end to his country's isolation. Before Trump's return to the White House, Iranian officials held nuclear talks with counterparts from Britain, France and Germany that both sides described as ""frank and constructive""."
Israel cuts ties with UN aid agency,"Israel cut ties with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees yesterday following accusations it provided cover for Hamas, a move likely to hamper delivery of its vital services after 15 months of offensive in Gaza. The agency, UNRWA, will be banned from operating on Israeli soil, and contact between it and Israeli officials will also be forbidden. UNRWA has provided support for Palestinian refugees around the Middle East for over 70 years, but has long clashed with Israeli officials, who have repeatedly accused it of undermining the country's security. The hostility intensified in the wake of Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, with accusations that UNRWA employees participated in the assault. ""Humanitarian aid doesn't equal UNRWA, and UNRWA doesn't equal humanitarian aid. UNRWA equals an organisation infested with Hamas terror activity,"" Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Oren Marmorstein wrote on social media platform X ahead of the ban. ""This is why, beginning on January 30 and in accordance with Israeli law, Israel will have no contact with UNRWA."" Meanwhile, Hamas freed three Israeli hostages and five foreigners in return for 110 Palestinian prisoners to be freed in the latest stage of a ceasefire deal. AFP reporters later yesterday said two buses carrying freed Palestinian prisoners left Ofer prison. First to be freed was Israeli woman soldier Agam Berger, 20, handed over to International Committee of the Red Cross officials in Jabalia in the north of the Palestinian territory. The Israeli military said another two Israelis and five foreigners were later handed over to the Red Cross and en route for Israel. The Palestinian prisoners, who include 30 minors and some members of Palestinian groups convicted for their involvement in deadly attacks in Israel, were set to be taken to the West Bank or Gaza later in the day. Before yesterday's release of hostages, Hamas had released seven hostages, with 290 prisoners freed in exchange."
Devotees gather for final prayer at Ijtema ground,"The first phase of Biswa Ijtema will conclude today with the Akheri Munajat on the bank of the Turag river in Tongi. Muslims from all over the country have been gathering at the Ijtema ground since 4:00am to join the concluding prayer. Maulana Kefayet Ullah, the top cleric of Shura-e-Nezami, said that the prayer will begin at 9:00am. The final prayer will be led by Maulana Zubair, the top cleric of Shuray-e-Nezam of Bangladesh. Since early morning, devotees have been making their way to the Ijtema ground via the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway. Many have walked the entire 10-kilometre distance from Bhogra bypass to the Ijtema ground. Mohammad Rafiqul Islam, the manager of the Ijtema medical camp, reported that 22 medical centres are providing services this year. GMP Commissioner Nazmul Karim Khan announced that from midnight on Saturday, certain roads, including the Tongi-Kamarpara Road, Dhaka-Mymensingh highway from Tongi to Gazipur's Bhogra Bypass, and Abdullahpur to Ashulia's Bypass, will be closed to traffic. Vehicles heading to Mymensingh and Gazipur should use the 300-foot road via Gabtoli to Konabari. Except for Ijtema-related vehicles, no transport will be allowed on these roads during this period. So far, 63 marriages were completed during the first phase of the Ijtema."

The wait is over!,"The atmosphere around Dhaka University was filled with a special energy yesterday, reflected in the streets and the eager faces of visitors. After all, it was the first day of the month-long festival of books. As soon as the clock struck 5:00pm and the gates of Suhrawardy Udyan opened, enthusiastic book lovers poured into the fairgrounds, exploring the vast collection of literary works. Earlier in the day, Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus inaugurated the Amar Ekushey Boi Mela at 3:00pm. The theme of this year's book fair, ""July Gono-Obbhutthan: Natun Bangladesh Binirman,"" carries profound significance, coming in the wake of the July uprising that led to the fall of the Awami League government. The echoes of that movement resonate throughout the fair, transforming it into not only a celebration of literature but also a reflection on the power of people's voices. The influence of the July uprising is particularly evident in the newly introduced ""July Corner,"" dedicated to showcasing literature and narratives surrounding the movement. The colours chosen for this year's fair -- red, black, and white -- hold deep symbolism: red represents revolution, black signifies mourning, and white symbolises the eternal lamp of hope. As in previous years, commercial publishing houses have set up their stalls at Suhrawardy Udyan, while government-run offices, autonomous bodies, and social organisations occupy spaces within the Bangla Academy premises. During a visit, this correspondent saw crowds gathered around popular publishing houses such as Anyaprokash, UPL, Anannya Prakashan, Batighor, Agami, Kotha Prokash, and many others, eagerly browsing and purchasing their favourite books. While some stalls were still finalising decorations, the festive spirit remained undiminished. ""I have been eagerly waiting for this day. I love reading books, especially on historical topics,"" said Jahangir Alam, a student at Dhaka University. His younger brother, fifth-grader Abu Humaira, added, ""I prefer horror stories -- they are more thrilling."" Atika Anowar, a private university student, said, ""Even though it's just the first day, I couldn't resist coming. I've been visiting the fair since my college days."" The fair will be open daily from 3:00pm to 9:00pm, except on public holidays, and will run until February 29. On February 21, in observance of International Mother Language Day, the fair will open at 8:00am and continue until 9:00pm. Publishers are hopeful for strong sales this year as visitors can finally enjoy the fair without restrictions. ""Our business has suffered over the past couple of years. This year, we hope to recover from those losses,"" said Aditya Antor, co-owner of Ittadi Grantha Prokash, speaking to The Daily Star. Regarding the scrutiny of manuscripts before publishing books at the book fair, Cultural Adviser Mostofa Sarwar Farooki said, ""A media report is causing misunderstanding. It cites a police official claiming that books should be submitted to Bangla Academy or the police for review before printing. This is unbelievable, this is absurd. It is nowhere near our government's policy."" He made these remarks yesterday morning while delivering the keynote speech as the chief guest at the inauguration ceremony of the Jatiya Kabita Utsab, held at the Central Library premises of Dhaka University. The Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) has clarified that no decision or suggestion has been made requiring police approval for manuscripts before publication at the book fair. In a press release yesterday, the DMP said they had only requested Bangla Academy to be cautious in allowing ""provocative"" books at the fair. During a security inspection at Suhrawardy Udyan on Friday, DMP Commissioner SM Sazzat Ali said, ""We have asked Bangla Academy officials to ensure that no books containing provocative language or content are displayed at the fair. These should be carefully reviewed before being placed in stalls."" However, the DMP emphasised in its statement, ""No decision or suggestion has been made by the police regarding the vetting or approval of books for future publication."""
"1,500 videos, photos of July atrocities collected","Bangladesh Protest Archive, a digital platform that has been collecting videos, audio recordings, and photos documenting the state-led atrocities, including police brutality, perpetrated during the July uprising last year, announced its official launch yesterday. Two non-profit organisations—Activate Rights, which advocates digital rights among youth in Bangladesh, and Witness, an international organisation that helps human rights defenders use video to expose injustice—are jointly collaborating on the initiative. The launching ceremony was organised at DrikPath Bhobon in the capital's Panthapath yesterday. Bangladesh Protest Archive aims to use digital evidence of the gross human rights violations during the July uprising to pursue justice through formal channels in Bangladesh and internationally. It has so far collected around 1,500 videos and photos from open sources, including social media, as well as from journalists and the public. The platform also allows independent users to contribute to the archive by uploading media recorded personally or media recorded by trusted sources to its website (bangladeshprotestarchive.com). Prominent photographer Shahidul Alam, Dhaka-based fact-checkers Qadaruddin Shishir and Minhaj Aman, researcher Altaf Parvez, and human rights defender Mustain Billah, also a member of the interim government's Constitutional Reform Commission, spoke at yesterday's event. Shoeb Abdullah, a founder of Activate Rights, who moderated the programme, said that the archive will initially focus on visual evidence of the human rights violations that took place during the July uprising. ""This archive can be instrumental in pursuing justice and making sure that this critical period of Bangladesh's history is not forgotten and that those responsible for human rights violations are held accountable,"" he added. Qadaruddin Shishir said they faced obstacles in collecting videos, as many were deleted by state forces or social media platforms. ""In July, during block raids in different areas, law enforcers raided houses, seized mobile phones and digital devices, and systematically deleted videos from eyewitnesses,"" he said. He added that social media platforms also removed videos, either for graphic content or due to coordinated reporting. ""So far, we have collected around 1,500 videos and photos. The actual number is much higher. Now, our task is to analyse the videos and conduct a foolproof investigation, case by case,"" he said. He further said that some researchers of genocide studies at international universities have expressed interest in using this archive for academic purposes. Minhaj Aman explained why their task is different from other countries, noting that most media outlets in Bangladesh lack a strong archive. ""In other countries, mainstream media is a primary source for such archives. However, most of our media here, except for Prothom Alo and The Daily Star, don't have a robust archive,"" he said, adding that this is why they have collected more media from social media, which prolongs the verification process. Researcher Altaf Parvez said that Bangladesh's newspapers played a vital role in documenting the events of the July uprising, which will be valuable for archiving the uprising. Shahidul Alam said, ""Many people documented videos and photos on their mobile phones during the uprising, and while some may consider them unimportant, these can be crucial in identifying the perpetrators behind any violence or crimes."" Citing several examples, Shahidul Alam urged people to share the documents with those working on the archive, as they could help prevent such serious human rights abuses from occurring under any government in Bangladesh in the future."
Ekushey spirit helped inspire July uprising,"Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus today said the spirit of Amar Ekushey inspired the country's people to wage the July uprising aiming to build a ""New Bangladesh"". While addressing at the inaugural session of Amar Ekushey Boi Mela at the capital's Suhrawardy Udyan, he said the great explosive power that ignited the July uprising was hidden in the blood of Barkat, Salam, Rafiq, and Jabbar. After half a century, the indomitable sprit of the martyrs of language movement gave strength to the people for the mass uprising and changed the country, he added. The chief adviser said this explosion instilled the determination of building a ""New Bangladesh"" and was deeply rooted in the country's 170 million people. ""We have come to take an oath on this commitment through this ceremony of Amar Ekushey,"" he said. Yunus said on August 5 last year, the historic student-mass uprising brought down a 16-year autocratic regime. The chief adviser recalled with deep respect all the courageous students, masses and workers who gave their lives and were brutally injured in the July uprising. The uprising achieved through great sacrifice has brought this year's book fair before the people with a new significance, he said. The theme of this year's book fair is ""The July uprising: Rebuilding a new Bangladesh"". ""The July uprising strongly united the nation. Because of this, we found the courage to rebuild a country devastated economically, politically, institutionally, and humanely,"" he said. ""Our young men and women, teenagers, painted their dreams, their aspirations, their demands on the walls of the streets with incredible determination. Our street walls have now been transformed into historical documents,"" he said. Congratulating the book fair organisers for presenting these murals at gates of the fair, the chief adviser said the boi mela, organised by Bangla Academy, has become an integral part of national life. Stressing the need for recognising the contributions of Bangladeshi expatriates and expatriate workers, he said Bangladeshis are showing their achievements in various fields all over the world. ""We want to remember all of them on Ekushey. They all celebrate Ekushey February remembering their country...,"" Yunus said."
Indian munitions factory blast kills eight,"At least eight people were killed and seven injured in a blast at an ordnance factory in the western Indian state of Maharashtra yesterday, a senior federal minister said. It was unclear what had caused the blast. The factory is located in Bhandara district of the state, nearly 830 km (515 miles) from India's financial capital of Mumbai, and manufactures propellants and explosives, according to local media. ""There has been a big explosion in the ordnance factory in Bhandara. According to preliminary information, eight people have died and seven have been injured,"" federal transport minister Nitin Gadkari, who is from Maharashtra, said at an event in Nagpur city. Earlier, the chief minister of the state Devendra Fadnavis said a roof in the factory had collapsed after the explosion, and that 13-14 workers were feared to be trapped inside, while five people had been rescued. Medical and rescue teams were at the site, the chief minister said in a post on X. Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the blast. Industrial disasters are common in India, with experts blaming poor planning and lax enforcement of safety rules. Nine workers were killed in a 2023 blast at a factory in Maharashtra that manufactured drones and explosives."
UK to become first country to criminalise AI child abuse tools,"Britain will become the first country to introduce laws against AI tools used to generate sexual abuse images, the government announced Saturday. The government will make it illegal to possess, create or distribute AI tools designed to generate sexualised images of children, punishable by up to five years in prison, interior minister Yvette Cooper revealed. It will also be illegal to possess AI ""paedophile manuals"" which teach people how to use AI to sexually abuse children, punishable by up to three years in prison. ""We know that sick predators' activities online often lead to them carrying out the most horrific abuse in person,"" said Cooper. The new laws are ""designed to keep our children safe online as technologies evolve. It is vital that we tackle child sexual abuse online as well as offline,"" she added. ""Children will be protected from the growing threat of predators generating AI images and from online sexual abuse as the UK becomes the first country in the world to create new AI sexual abuse offences,"" said a government statement. AI tools are being used to generate child sexual abuse images by ""nudeifying"" real life images of children or by ""stitching the faces of other children onto existing images,"" said the government. The new laws will also criminalise ""predators who run websites designed for other paedophiles to share vile child sexual abuse content or advice on how to groom children,"" punishable by up to ten years in prison, said the government. The measures will be introduced as part of the Crime and Policing Bill when it comes to parliament. The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) has warned of the growing number of sexual abuse AI images of children being produced. Over a 30-day period in 2024, IWF analysts identified 3,512 AI child abuse images on a single dark web site. The number of the most serious category of images also rose by 10 percent in a year, it found."
"For world's poorest, fears for long-term setbacks after Trump aid cut","In Uganda, millions of schoolchildren have benefitted from a universal education program backed by the United States. In South Sudan, US assistance has helped thousands of flood victims at risk of cholera. With one swoop of the pen, President Donald Trump froze the bulk of US foreign assistance for three months on returning to office, demanding a review to ensure all money meets his ""America First"" principles. The Trump administration has since issued waivers for food and other humanitarian aid. But aid workers say uncertainty reigns -- and that the impact is already being felt by some of the world's most vulnerable. Even if US assistance returns after the 90-day review, aid workers fear long-term consequences from the cutoff, and some observers see a lasting blow to US credibility as China and other powers woo the developing world. ""Even if the funding eventually turns back on, great damage will have been done,"" said Peter Waiswa, an accountant in Kamuli, Uganda who coordinates aid as part of a network known as the Compassion Connectors. ""Missing drugs for days for the HIV/AIDS patients can cause death,"" he said. Waiswa said that some schools in the universal education program that relied on US assistance have already given notices for children not to report to school. In Aweil in the northern reaches of impoverished South Sudan, orphanage teacher James Akoon Akot said that 3,000 people who lost their homes in floods were promised relief by international groups backed by US assistance. ""The problem is that aid is used for both immediate relief and reconstruction,"" he said. ""If this decision to cut off funds is not reconsidered soon, there is a very real possibility that people will begin to die of hunger and diseases in South Sudan,"" he said. Uncertainly reigns The United States has long been the world's largest provider of development aid, giving $64 billion in 2023. Among its most prominent programs is PEPFAR, the anti-HIV/AIDS initiative started under former president George W. Bush that is credited with saving some 26 million lives. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a memo signed on January 24 froze all US assistance with waivers for ""emergency food"" and, outside of development, weapons for Israel and Egypt. In a follow-up memo, he exempted other humanitarian assistance including shelter and medicine, appearing to give the greenlight for anti-retroviral drugs funded by PEPFAR. But Suzy Dzimbiri, a nurse in Zumba, Malawi, said she heard of people stockpiling whatever medicine they can and that one local charity that administered HIV/AIDS treatment, named Lighthouse, quickly closed down. In Washington, a congressional aide who follows humanitarian assistance said that even a nine-day shutdown in theory affects one million daily doses of HIV/AIDS medication -- and that guidance was still murky. ""It sounds like people expect PEPFAR to go ahead, but we have nothing in terms of specifics,"" the aide said. ""We do know of cases where there has been medicine sitting on the shelf and ready to go and that it's been ordered to stay on the shelf"" pending guidance from Washington, the aide said on condition of anonymity. ""PEPFAR was supposed to be our Marshall Plan. The idea that we would just flip a switch and it would all turn off shows us to be capricious -- we don't actually care -- and that going forward they probably do need to look to countries like China,"" the aide said. 'We don't want to see people die' Explaining his decision to issue further waivers, Rubio said, ""We don't want to see people die and the like."" But he said that the waiver process was rightfully forcing groups to justify spending as ""historically we've gotten very little cooperation."" ""We have this thing that I've called the foreign aid industrial complex -- all of these entities around the world that are getting millions and millions of dollars from the United States,"" Rubio said in an interview with SiriusXM. ""We have to make sure that it's aligned with our national interest."" A senior official from a US-based organization feared that the priority on ""emergency"" assistance was part of a broader plan to say eventually that the United States need not fund anything else. ""Even the term 'emergency food' is a contradiction in terms. You go without food for a few days, and I'll tell you what emergency food looks like,"" said the official, who requested anonymity so as not to upset US government contacts. The official said that the most affected by the cutoff were local groups that did not have financial reserves -- exactly the types of organizations that US officials want to build up. ""This is essentially like burning down the foundations with the professed aim of renovating your house."""
Trudeau announces tariffs on US in retaliation for Trump's tariffs,"Canada will retaliate against President Donald Trump's new tariffs by imposing 25% tariffs U.S. goods from drinks to appliances, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Saturday. As relations between the long-time allies who share the world's longest land border reach a new low, Trudeau told a news conference he was slapping tariffs on C$155 billion ($107 billion) of U.S. goods. Those on C$30 billion will take effect on Tuesday, the same day as Trump's tariffs, and duties on the remaining C$125 billion in 21 days, he said. Trudeau's announcement came just hours after Trump ordered 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports and 10% on goods from China, risking a trade war that economists say could slow global growth and reignite inflation. Trudeau warned the coming weeks would be difficult for Canadians and that Trump's tariffs would also hurt Americans. Addressing Americans, he said: ""They will raise costs for you, including food at the grocery store, gas at the pump. They will impede your access to an affordable supply of vital goods."" The Canadian leader said tariffs would include American beer, wine and bourbon, as well as fruits and fruit juices, including orange juice from Trump's home state of Florida. Canada would also target goods including clothing, sports equipment and household appliances. Canada is considering non-tariff measures, potentially relating to critical minerals, energy procurement and other partnerships, Trudeau said. Trudeau encouraged Canadians to buy Canadian products and vacation at home rather than in the U.S. ""We didn't ask for this but we will not back down,"" Trudeau said."
Trump repeats 100% tariffs threat to BRICS nations,"US President Donald Trump has warned the BRICS member countries against replacing the US dollar as a reserve currency by repeating a 100 percent-tariffs threat he had made weeks after winning the November presidential elections. ""We are going to require a commitment from these seemingly hostile Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty US Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs,"" he said on Thursday on Truth Social in a statement nearly identical to one he posted on November 30. Trump posted his warning to the BRICS as Canada and Mexico await for his decision to follow through on a pledge to impose 25 percent tariffs on the United States' North American trading partner from today. The BRICS grouping includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa and a few other countries that joined in the past couple of year. The Kremlin yesterday brushed off the repeat threat by Trump to impose tariffs on the BRICS grouping of countries, saying there was and never had been such a plan. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said BRICS was not talking about setting up its own currency, but merely about creating joint investment platforms. ""In all likelihood, US experts probably need to explain the BRICS agenda in more detail to Mr Trump,"" he added. A study by the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center last year showed that the US dollar remains the world's primary reserve currency, and neither the euro nor the so-called BRICS countries have been able to reduce global reliance on the dollar. The bloc was founded as an informal club in 2009 to provide a platform for its members to challenge a world order dominated by the United States and its Western allies. South Africa was the first beneficiary of an expansion of the bloc in 2010 when the grouping became known as BRICS. The group added Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates in 2023, and Indonesia became member earlier this month."
"2,500 Gaza children at ‘imminent risk’ of death","United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has demanded that 2,500 children be immediately evacuated from Gaza for medical treatment after meeting with US doctors who said the children were at imminent risk of death in the coming weeks. The four doctors had all volunteered in Gaza during the 15-month-long offensive that has devastated the enclave of more than 2 million people and its healthcare system. Just days before a ceasefire began on January 19, the World Health Organization said more than 12,000 patients were waiting for medical evacuations and it had hoped they could be ramped up during the truce. Among those patients urgently needing treatment are 2,500 children, said Feroze Sidhwa, a California trauma surgeon who worked in Gaza from March 25 to April 8 last year. ""There's about 2,500 children who are at imminent risk of death in the next few weeks. Some are dying right now. Some will die tomorrow. Some will die the next day,"" Sidhwa told reporters on Thursday after meeting with Guterres. The UN Palestinian relief agency UNRWA said yesterday that if its humanitarian work in Gaza is forced to halt, it would put a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas at risk. UNRWA, however, said its humanitarian work across the occupied territories and Gaza was still ongoing yesterday despite an Israeli ban that took effect a day before and what it described as hostility towards its staff. Meanwhile, Hamas said yesterday it would free the father of the youngest hostages seized on October 7, 2023 and two others including a dual US citizen today in the next exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Israel is also set to free 90 inmates today in exchange for the three Israeli hostages in the fourth swap of Gaza ceasefire, a Palestinian advocacy group said. US President Donald Trump insisted on Thursday that Egypt and Jordan would take in displaced Gazans, despite the two Arab nations dismissing his plan to move Palestinians from the territory. Trump's comments came a day after Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Jordan's King Abdullah II rejecting any forced displacement of Gaza civilians following the war between Hamas and Israel. In the Gaza Strip, the European Union (EU) has restarted its civilian mission to monitor the border crossing between Gaza and Egypt at Rafah, the bloc's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said yesterday. ""The EU's civilian border mission deploys today to the Rafah Crossing at the request of the Palestinians and the Israelis. It will support Palestinian border personnel and allow the transfer of individuals out of Gaza, including those who need medical care"", she said on social media platform X."
